1
00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:07,220
好，今天，我想更多地讨论一些
all right today I want to talk about bit

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,510
关于容错和复制的问题
more about fault tolerance and

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,549
然后深入研究
replication and then look into the

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:13,269
今天的关于 VMware 容错的论文的详细内容
details of today's paper about vmware ft

5
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:16,010
话题回到容错上来
the topics still fault tolerance to

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,040
容错以提供高可用性————
provide high availability that is you

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,600
例如：当你想构建一个服务器时
want to build a server that even if some

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,820
提供服务的硬件总是有崩溃的可能
hardware you know computer crashes is

9
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,080
但是
involved in the service we still like to

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,860
我们还是希望能稳定地提供服务
provide the service and to the extent we

11
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,120
甚至，我们想（并且可以）在即使出现了网络问题的时候
can we'd like to provide our service

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,250
依旧提供我们的服务————
also if there's network problems and the

13
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,019
我们所使用到的工具就是“复制”
tool we're using its replication least

14
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:36,620
至少在本课程的这一部分是这样
for this part of the course so it's

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,070
一个很有价值的问题：
worth asking what kind of failures

16
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,039
复制能处理什么样的“失败”呢？
replication can be expected to deal with

17
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,480
因为这无论如何都不是一件小事
because it's not everything by any means

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,609
使用最简单的方法来描述一下
so maybe the easiest way to characterize

19
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:57,170
我们所能处理的那种“失败”————
the kind of failures we're talking about

20
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,010
那就是单个计算机的“停止-失败”
is fail stop failures of a single

21
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:11,119
我所谓的“停止-失败”是什么呢？
computer and what I mean by fail stop

22
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,840
其实是一种通用的术语
it's a sort of generic term and fault

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,759
容错就是说如果有一些东西出了故障
tolerance is that if something goes

24
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:18,350
比如说一台计算机出了什么问题
wrong would say the computer the

25
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,840
它就会简单地停止运行
computer simply stops executing it just

26
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,649
如果任何东西出了什么故障的话
stops if anything goes wrong and in

27
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,240
尤其需要注意的是：它不会计算出不正确的结果
particular it doesn't compute incorrect

28
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,640
所以，如果有人断了你的电源
results so if somebody kicks the power

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,240
把电源线从你的服务器上拔了出来
cable out of your server that's probably

30
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,950
那就有可能产生一个“停止-失败”
gonna generate a fail stop failure

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,090
类似地，如果他们拔了你的服务器的网络插头
similarly if they unplug your servers

32
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,680
这也是一个“停止-失败”
network connection even though the

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,390
尽管你知道服务器仍在运行
server is still running so this is a

34
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,100
所以这就有点可笑
little bit funny you know be totally cut

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,420
因为对于网络另一头的我来说
off from the network so it looks at me

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,479
服务器断了网就和停止运行没啥两样
outside like it just stopped so it's

37
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,890
所以这些错误是我们可以处理的错误
really these failures we can deal with

38
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,810
复制能处理的问题也包括一些硬件问题
with replication this also covers some

39
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,479
比如
hardware problems like you know maybe if

40
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:02,299
你的服务器的风扇坏了
the fan on your server breaks because it

41
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,909
可能因为太便宜了，哈哈
you know it cost 50 cents maybe that'll

42
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:06,740
这就有可能使 CPU 过热
cause the CPU to overheat and the CPU

43
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,038
然后 CPU 就停止运行了
will shut itself down cleanly and just

44
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,849
干净利落
stop executing

45
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:18,469
我们所讨论的这种复制系统
what's not covered by the kind of

46
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:20,500
也有一些它不能处理的问题
replication systems we're talking about

47
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,109
比如软件问题、软件漏洞
is things like bugs and software or

48
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:29,359
或者一些更基本的、不是软件漏洞的硬件设计缺陷
design defects in hardware so basically

49
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:33,379
如果我们接受一些服务
not bugs because if we take some service

50
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,659
假如说，你有一台 MapReduce master 主机
you know say you're a MapReduce master

51
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,459
我们复制运行它
for example you know we replicated and

52
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:39,530
我们在两台计算机上复制运行它
run it on two computers you know if

53
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,180
如果你的 MapReduce master 有一个漏洞
there's a bug in your MapReduce master

54
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,540
或者我的 MapReduce master 有一个漏洞
or my MapReduce master let's say

55
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,379
那么复制对我们没有任何帮助
replications not going to help us we're

56
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,760
我们还是会得到计算错误的结果
going to compute the same incorrect

57
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,169
在两台 MapReduce master 主机上都是这样
result on both of our copies of our

58
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:53,959
并且从表面上看一切都好好的
MapReduce master and everything looked

59
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:55,669
它们会默默允许让你碰上一个错误答案
fine they'll agree you just happen to be

60
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,370
所以
the wrong answer so we can't depending

61
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,129
我们不能依赖于复制软件中的漏洞
against bugs in the replicated software

62
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,780
并且
and we can't defend against bugs in the

63
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,269
我们管理复制的方案中的漏洞也是不可防御的
whatever scheme we're using to manage

64
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,180
和我刚才提到的类似
the replication and similarly as I

65
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,739
我们不能期望处理硬件中的漏洞
mentioned before we can't expect to deal

66
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,180
这个硬件呢
with bugs in the hardware the hardware

67
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,950
它会计算出不正确的结果
it computes incorrectly that's just

68
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,530
事情也就这样了
that's the end for us at least with this

69
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,829
至少对于这种技术来说，也就如此了
kind of technique although you know that

70
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,930
尽管肯定有一些硬件和软件漏洞
said there are definitely hardware and

71
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,540
是复制能解决的
software bugs that that replication

72
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,699
如果你足够幸运的话
might if you're lucky might be able to

73
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:30,470
如果
cope it so if there's some unrelated

74
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,239
有一些不相关的软件运行在你的服务器上
software running in your server and it

75
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,430
它使你的服务器崩溃了
causes the server to crash maybe because

76
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,620
或者可能使你的 kernel 出现 panic 并重启
your kernel to panic and reboot or

77
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,449
或者什么也不做
something it has nothing to do with you

78
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:40,639
对你正复制的服务什么也不做
know with your with the service you're

79
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,709
那么
replicating then that kind of failure

80
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,650
这种错误对于我们的服务来说
for us for your service will may well be

81
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,290
就是一种“停止-失败”
fail stop

82
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,810
你懂的，kernel 将会 panic 
you know the kernel will panic and the

83
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,479
并且备份复制会取而代之
backup replicas will take over similarly

84
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,060
有一些种类的硬件错误
some kinds of hardware errors can be

85
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,260
可以被转化为“停止-失败”错误
turned into fail stop errors for example

86
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,599
例如：如果你通过网络发送了一个包
if you send a packet over the network

87
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,209
但是网络损坏了这个包，它翻转了一个比特位
and the network corrupts it just flips a

88
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:10,069
像这种情况
bit in your packet that will almost

89
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:11,930
几乎肯定可以通过校验和而检测出来
certainly be caught by the checksum on

90
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,939
一个磁盘块也是一样的
the packet same thing for a disk block

91
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,949
如果你往磁盘上写了一些数据
if you write some data to disk and read

92
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:18,199
然后一个月后又把它读出来
it back a month later you know maybe the

93
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:20,779
也许磁表面不是很完美
magnetic surface isn't perfect and you

94
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,010
在这个块上，最重要的那几个比特位是错的
know one of the best couple of bits were

95
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,539
但是它能被正确地读出来
wrong in the block as it's right back

96
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,980
这实际上是纠错功能
it's actually error correcting

97
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,990
能在一定程度上
that up to a certain point will fix

98
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,460
修复磁盘块中地错误
errors in disk blocks that you'll be

99
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,420
这样的话
turning you know random hardware errors

100
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,600
一些随机的硬件错误可以被纠正
into as either correcting them if you're

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,140
如果你超级幸运的话
super lucky or at least detecting them

102
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,910
或者至少可以检测到错误
and turning random corruption into a

103
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,730
从而让软件知道
detected fault which you know the

104
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,470
知道发生了错误
software then knows that something that

105
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,690
从而可以把硬件错误转化为一个“停止-失败”错误
wrong and can turn it into a fail stop

106
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,910
即时地停止运行或者采取一些其他的补救措施
fault by stopping executing or take some

107
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,190
但是，一般来说
other remedial action but in general we

108
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,560
我们只能期望去处理一些“停止-失败”错误
really can only expect to handle fail

109
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,180
复制还有一些其他的限制
stop faults there's other limits to

110
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,470
啊，其他限制
replication to you know the the failures

111
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,630
不管失败发生在主要的那个复制中
in the if we have a primary in the back

112
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,610
还是发生在备份的那个复制中或者其他怎样
of our two replicas or whatever we're

113
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,800
我们总是假设
really assuming that failures in the two

114
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
两个复制中的失败是相互独立的
are independent right if there tend to

115
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,310
如果两个复制中总是有相关联的失败
have correlated failures then

116
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,390
那么，复制将对我们没有帮助
replication is not going to help us so

117
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,340
例如，如果我们有一整套设备
for example if we're a big outfit and we

118
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,380
我们买了成千上万的计算机
buy thousands of computers batches of

119
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,390
啊，成千上万台计算机
thousands of computers identical

120
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,310
同一家厂商生产的成千上万的相同的计算机
computers from the same manufacturer and

121
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,070
我们把我们的复制运行在上面
we run you know our replicas is on all

122
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,650
我们一次在同一个地方买那么多电脑
on those computers we bought at the same

123
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,510
这可有一点风险
time from the same place that's a bit of

124
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,990
啊，有点风险
a risk

125
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,020
因为很可能
maybe because presumably if one of them

126
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,730
其中一个有了缺陷
has a manufacturing defect in it there's

127
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,130
其他的也有相同的缺陷
a good chance that the other ones do too

128
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,390
比如说
you know one of them's prone to

129
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,810
由于制造商没有设计好散热系统
overheating because the manufacturer you

130
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,220
导致其中的一个过热了
know didn't provide enough airflow well

131
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,500
那么很有可能这一批货都有这个问题
it probably all had that problem and so

132
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,990
所以如果其中一个过热、宕机了
one of them overheats and dies it's a

133
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,350
那么其他的也很有可能同样宕机
good chance that the other ones will too

134
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,060
这是相关失败的一种
so that's one kind of correlated failure

135
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,040
你要小心的是另一种
you just have to be careful of another

136
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,570
比如说
one is that you know if there's an

137
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,890
地震了
earthquake and the city where our

138
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,510
地震正好发生在存储着我们的数据的数据中心所在的城市
datacenter is probably gonna take out

139
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:07,310
在这种情况下
the whole data center you know we can

140
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,630
无论我们在那个数据中心里弄多少复制
have all the replication we like inside

141
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,010
也无济于事
that data center it's not going to help

142
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,080
因为这种失败
us because the failure caused by an

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,060
这种由地震、全市停电引起的失败
earthquake or a citywide power failure

144
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,950
或者建筑失火这种
or something the building burning down

145
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,720
它是相关失败
is like it's correlated failure between

146
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,490
同一建筑内的复制之间的相关失败
our replicas if they're on that building

147
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,290
所以如果我们想处理地震带来的问题
so if we care about dealing with

148
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,020
那么
earthquakes then we need to put our

149
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,150
我们需要把我们的复制放在不同的城市
replicas in maybe in just different

150
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,010
至少把它们在物理上足够分隔开
cities at least physically separate

151
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,720
让它们分别供电
enough that they have separate power

152
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,760
这样它们就不会被同一自然灾害所影响了
unlikely to be affected by the same

153
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,750
对，不会
natural disaster

154
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,790
好了，这就是全部种类的不稳定性了
okay but that's all sort of hovering in

155
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,170
至少在我们这次讨论的背景下
the background for this discussion where

156
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,510
我们所讨论的正是你可能会使用的技术
we're talking about the technology you

157
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,660
还有一个关于复制的问题
might use another question about

158
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,640
你可能会问你自己
replication is whether it's worthwhile

159
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,520
天呐
you may ask yourself gosh you know this

160
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,760
使用 2 倍甚至 3 倍计算机资源的复制方案，这真的值得吗
literally uses these replication schemes

161
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,190
使用 2 倍甚至 3 倍计算机资源的复制方案，这真的值得吗
use twice as much or three times as much

162
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,740
对了
computer resources right we need to have

163
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,480
我们需要让 GFS 的每一个 block 都有三份拷贝的话
you know GFS had three copies of every

164
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,130
我们就得买三倍容量的磁盘
blocks we have to buy three times as much

165
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,590
啊，今天的那篇论文呢
disk space the paper for today

166
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,870
只复制了一次
you know replicates just once but that

167
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,760
但是那意味着我们有两倍的计算机、CPU 和 RAM 
means we have twice as many computers

168
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,520
这些东西都是很昂贵的
and CPUs and RAM it's all for expensive

169
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,990
这真的很值得吗
like is that really worth it that

170
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,070
并且
expense and you know that's not

171
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,540
这不是一个我们能从技术上回答正确的问题
something we can answer technically

172
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,040
这是一个经济上的问题
right it's an economic question it

173
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,140
这个问题取决于获取一个可用的服务的价值
depends on the value of having an

174
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,940
这个问题取决于获取一个可用的服务的价值
available service you know if you're

175
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,090
比如说你在运行一个银行服务
running a bank and if the consequence is

176
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,740
计算机宕机的后果就是
the computer failing is that your

177
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,300
你不能服务你的顾客了
customer you can't serve your customers

178
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,220
你也就不能获得收入了
and you can't generate revenue and your

179
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,440
你的顾客们也会恨你
customers all hate you then it may well

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,540
权衡之下，多花一两万在一台备份计算机上很可能是值得的
be worth it to blow you know an extra

181
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,370
权衡之下，多花一两万在一台备份计算机上很可能是值得的
ten or twenty thousand bucks on a second

182
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,220
所以，你可以复制一份
computer so you can have a replica on

183
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,900
另一方面，假如你是我，你在运行维护 6.824 的网站服务器
the other hand if you're me and you're

184
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,220
另一方面，假如你是我，你在运行维护 6.824 的网站服务器
running the 6.824 web server I don't

185
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,680
我觉得不值得给 6.824 网站做热备份
consider it worthwhile to have a hot

186
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,960
我觉得不值得给 6.824 网站做热备份
backup of the 84 web server because the

187
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,340
因为运行失败所造成的后果没什么大不了的
consequences of failure are very low so

188
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,460
复制是否值得？
the whether the replication is

189
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,230
该复制多少份？
worthwhile on how many replicas you

190
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,090
这都取决于
ought to have and how much you're

191
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,220
你愿意花费多少在这上面
willing to spend on it is all about how

192
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,330
取决于当失败发生时会给你带来多大的损失和不便
much cost and inconvenience failure

193
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,840
好了
would call it cause you all right this

194
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,810
开头提到的这篇论文
paper sort of in the beginning mentions

195
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,270
介绍了几种不同的复制方法
as there's a couple of different

196
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,820
啊，其实介绍了两种
approaches to replication really

197
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,740
一种叫做 状态转移
mentions two one two calls state

198
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:30,350
另一种叫做 复制状态机
transfer and the other calls replicated

199
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,150
在这个班上呢
state machine most of the schemes we're

200
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,230
我们主要讨论复制状态机
going to talk about in this class are

201
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,280
我们主要讨论复制状态机
replicated state machines

202
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,799
但我们也会讨论状态转移的
it'll talk about both anyway the idea

203
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,179
状态转移背后的思想是
behind state transferor's that if we

204
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:49,100
如果我们有一个服务器的两份复制
have two replicas of a server the way

205
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,470
你让它们保持同步的方式就是
you cause them to be to stay in sync

206
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,010
让它们成为实际上的复制
that is to be actual replicas so that

207
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,529
使备份拥有它需要的一切
the backup can has everything it needs

208
00:08:57,529 --> 00:08:59,630
以便当主机宕机时备份能够接管
to take over if the primary fails in a

209
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,390
在一个状态转移模式中
state transfer scheme the way that works

210
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,490
它工作的方式就是，主机发送一份整个自身状态的拷贝
is that the primary sends a copy of its

211
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,320
比如
entire state that is for example the

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,140
它内存的内容，把它发送给备份
contents of its RAM to the backup and

213
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,209
备份只是存储最新的状态
the backup just sort of stores the

214
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,279
这样，备份就有全部的主机状态
latest state and so it's all there

215
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,470
主机如果宕机了的话
the primary fails in the backup can

216
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,680
备份就可以开始运行在最新状态
start executing with this last state it

217
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,899
如果主机宕机了的话
got if the primary fails so this is all

218
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,750
所以这完全就是发送主机的状态
about sending the state of the of the

219
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,450
今天
primary and for today's if today's paper

220
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:28,250
如果今天的论文以一个状态转移系统来运行的话
worked as a state transfer system which

221
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,899
其实并不是
it doesn't then the state we'd be

222
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:31,339
我们所讨论的状态就是 RAM 里的内容
talking about would be the contents of

223
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:33,320
主机的内存里的内容
the RAM the contents of the memory of

224
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,959
所以
the primary so maybe every once while

225
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,390
可能每次主机复制了一大份拷贝
the primary would just you know make a

226
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,890
一大份自身内存的拷贝并且发送的时候
big copy of its memory and send it

227
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,600
需要通过网络发送给备份
across the network to the backup you can

228
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,860
imagine if you wanted to be efficient

229
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,089
you know maybe you would only send the

230
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,950
parts of the memory that it's changed

231
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,020
since the last time you sent in memory

232
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,709
to the backup the replicated state

233
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:52,940
machine

234
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,850
this approach observes that most

235
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,560
services are most computer things we

236
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,589
want to replicate have some internal

237
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,330
operation that's deterministic except

238
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,839
when external input comes in right you

239
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,880
know ordinarily if there's no external

240
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,770
influences on a computer it just

241
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,330
executes one instruction after another

242
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,010
and what each instruction does is a

243
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,770
deterministic function of what's in the

244
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,390
memory and the registers of the computer

245
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,400
and it's only when external events

246
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,190
intervene that something unexpected may

247
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,440
happen like a packet arrives of a some

248
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,550
random time and that causes the server

249
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,800
to start doing something differently I'm

250
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,410
so replicated state machine schemes

251
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,260
don't send the state between the

252
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,029
replicas instead they just send those

253
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,500
external events they just send maybe

254
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,839
from a primary to a backup again just

255
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,420
send things like arriving input from the

256
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,550
outside world that the backup needs to

257
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:52,910
know

258
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,370
and the observation is that you know if

259
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,050
you have to two computers and they start

260
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,110
from the same state and they see the

261
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,740
same inputs that that in the same order

262
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,810
or at the same time the two computers

263
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,150
will continue to be replicas of each

264
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,490
other and sort of execute identically as

265
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,020
long as they both see the same inputs at

266
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:17,360
the same time so this transfers probably

267
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,380
memory and this transfer some primary

268
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,670
backup just operations from clients or

269
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,890
external external inputs or external

270
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:33,230
events and you know the reason why

271
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,810
people tend to favor a replicated state

272
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,350
machine is that usually operations are

273
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,630
smaller than the state but this you know

274
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,130
the state of a server if it's a database

275
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,630
server might be the entire database

276
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,060
might be you know gigabytes whereas the

277
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,680
operations are just some clients sending

278
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,110
and you know please read or write key 27

279
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,690
operations are usually small the states

280
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,190
usually large so replicate a state

281
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,470
machine usually looks attractive and

282
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,090
slight downside is that the schemes tend

283
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,490
to be quite a bit more complicated and

284
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,900
rely on sort of more assumptions about

285
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,930
how the computers operate whereas this

286
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,640
is a really heavy-handed I'm just gonna

287
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,380
send you my whole state sort of a

288
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,440
nothing to worry about

289
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:22,180
any questions about these strategies yes

290
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,930
well the did ok so the question is

291
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,760
suppose something went wrong with our

292
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,410
scheme and the backup was not actually

293
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:40,579
identical to the primary so you know

294
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:44,790
you're suppose we were running GFS

295
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:47,220
master and it's the primary it just

296
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,949
handed out at least two chunks server

297
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:55,019
one but because the two you know because

298
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,910
we've allowed the states of the primary

299
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,910
back to drift out of sync the backup did

300
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,470
not issue at least to anybody it wasn't

301
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,850
even away or anybody had asked for these

302
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,380
so now the primary thinks you know

303
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,880
chunks everyone has lease for some chunk

304
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,600
in the backup doesn't the primary fails

305
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,250
backup takes over right now chunks over

306
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,620
one thinks it has a lease for some chunk

307
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,850
but then the current master doesn't and

308
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,440
is happy to hand out the lease to some

309
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
other trunk server now we have to chunk

310
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,250
servers serving the same lease okay so

311
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,230
that's just a close to home example but

312
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,019
really you know almost any bad thing and

313
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,230
kind of I think you construct any bad

314
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,880
scenario by just imagining some service

315
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,579
that confuse the wrong answer because

316
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,480
the state's leverage

317
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,610
so you're asking about randomization

318
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,850
yeah oh y'all talk about this I'll talk

319
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,950
about this a bit later on but it is good

320
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:58,320
that the replicated state scheme

321
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,880
definitely makes the most sense when the

322
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,320
instructions that the primary in the

323
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,570
back of our executing do the same thing

324
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,370
as long as there's no external events

325
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,740
right and that's almost true right you

326
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,480
know for an add instruction or something

327
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,880
yeah you know if the starting if the

328
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,350
registers and memory of the same and they

329
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,790
both execute an add instruction add instruction

330
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,080
has the same inputs in

331
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,730
the same outputs but they're in some

332
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,200
instructions as you point out that don't

333
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,880
like maybe there's an instruction that

334
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,400
gets the current time of day now

335
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,690
probably be executed at slightly

336
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,790
different times or an instruction that

337
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,250
gets the current processors unique ID

338
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,830
and a serial number it's going to yield

339
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,400
the different answers and the the the

340
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,930
uniform answered the questions that

341
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,360
sound like this is that the primary does

342
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,730
it and sends the answer to the backup

343
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,830
and the backup does not execute that

344
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,900
instruction but instead at the point

345
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,120
where it would execute that instruction

346
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,740
it listens for the primary to tell it

347
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,090
what the right answer would be and just

348
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,670
sort of fakes that answer to the

349
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,810
software I'll talk about you know how

350
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,550
the VMware scheme does that okay

351
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,690
interestingly enough though today's

352
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,810
paper is all about a replicated state

353
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,150
machine you may have noticed that

354
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,680
today's paper only deals with you know

355
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,330
processors and it's not that clear how

356
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,680
it could be extended to a multi-core and

357
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,810
a multi-core machine where the

358
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,550
interleavings of the instructions from

359
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,750
the two cores organ are

360
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,610
non-deterministic all right so we no

361
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,720
longer have this situation on a

362
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,670
multi-core machine where if we just let

363
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,200
the primary and backup execute they're

364
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,970
you know all else being equal they're

365
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,670
going to be the same because they won't

366
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,530
execute on multiple cores VMware has

367
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,600
since come out with a new possibly

368
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,240
completely different replication system

369
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,070
that does work on multi-core and the new

370
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,890
system appears to me to be using state

371
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,530
transfer instead of replicated state

372
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,940
machine because state transferred is

373
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,190
more robust in the face

374
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,340
multi-core and parallelism if you use

375
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,380
the machine and send the memory over you

376
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,690
know that the memory image is just that

377
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,250
just is the state of the machine and

378
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,470
sort of it doesn't matter that there was

379
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,600
parallelism whereas the replicated state

380
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,280
machine scheme really has a problem with

381
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,780
the parallelism you know on the other

382
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,000
hand I'm guessing that this new

383
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,930
multi-core scheme is more expensive okay

384
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,660
all right so if we want to build a

385
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,250
replicated state machine scheme we got a

386
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:31,200
number of questions to answer so we need

387
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,430
to decide at what level we're gonna

388
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,360
replicate state right so what state what

389
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:44,430
do we mean by state we have to worry

390
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,670
about how how closely synchronized the

391
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,710
primary and backup have to be right

392
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,810
because it's likely the primary will

393
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,400
execute a little bit ahead of the backup

394
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,110
after all it it's the primary that sees

395
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,570
the inputs so the backup almost

396
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,360
necessarily must lag over that gives

397
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,950
that means there's an opportunity if the

398
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,500
primary fails for the prime for the

399
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,849
backup not to be fully caught up having

400
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,760
the backup actually executes really in

401
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,959
lockstep with the primaries for

402
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,550
expensive because it requires a lot of

403
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,319
chitchat so a lot of designs a lot of

404
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,470
what people sweat about is how close the

405
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:27,810
synchronization is if the primary fails

406
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,760
or you know actually if the backup fails too

407
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,590
but it's more exciting if the primary

408
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,210
fails there has to be some scheme for

409
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,650
switching over and the clients have to

410
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,830
know oh gosh I instead of talking to the

411
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,780
old primary on server one I should now

412
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,520
be talking to the

413
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,970
the backup on server to all the clients

414
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,280
have to somehow figure this out the

415
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,340
switch over almost certainly it's almost

416
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,860
impossible maybe impossible to design a

417
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,560
cut over system in which no anomalies

418
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
are every are ever visible you know in

419
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,000
this sort of ideal world if the primary

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,070
fails we'd like nobody to ever notice

421
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,080
none of the clients to notice turns out

422
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,920
that's basically unattainable so there's

423
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,120
going to be anomalies during the cut

424
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,500
over and we've gotta figure out a way to

425
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,560
cope with them and finally if the one of

426
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,750
the two if one of our replicas fails we

427
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,790
really need to have a new replica right

428
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,820
if we have a two replicas and one fails

429
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,010
we're just living on borrowed time right

430
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,710
because the second replica may fail at

431
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,990
some point so we absolutely need to get

432
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,240
a new replica back online as fast as

433
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,250
possible so and that can be very

434
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,610
expensive the state is big you know you

435
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,690
know but the reason we like to replicate

436
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,190
a state machine was because we thought

437
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,320
state transfer would be expensive but

438
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,450
the two replicas in a replicated state

439
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,040
machine still need to have full state

440
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,230
right we just had a cheap way of keeping

441
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,210
them both in sync if we need to create a

442
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,700
new replica we actually have no choice

443
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,410
but state transfer to create the new

444
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,090
replicas the new replica needs to have a

445
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,090
complete copy of the state so it's going

446
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:08,100
to be expensive to create new replicas

447
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:15,300
and this is often people spending well

448
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,530
actually people spend a lot of time

449
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,750
worrying about all these questions and

450
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,490
you know we'll see them again as we look

451
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,980
at other replicated state machine

452
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:29,460
schemes so on the topic of what state to

453
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,720
replicate the today's paper has a very

454
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,880
interesting answer to this question it

455
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,160
replicates the full state of the machine

456
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,060
that is all of memory and all the

457
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,030
Machine registers it's like a very very

458
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,780
detailed replication scheme just no

459
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,120
difference at the even of the lowest

460
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,620
levels between the primary in the backup

461
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,560
that's quite rare for replication

462
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,670
schemes

463
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,680
almost always you see something that's

464
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,200
more like GFS where GFS absolutely did

465
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,630
not replicate you know they had

466
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,700
replication but it wasn't replicating

467
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,220
every single you know bit of memory

468
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,170
between the primaries and the backups

469
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,180
it was replicating much more application

470
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,910
level table of chunks

471
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,950
I had this abstraction of you know

472
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,630
chunks and chunk identifiers and that's

473
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,370
what it was replicating it wasn't

474
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:22,290
replicating sort of everything else

475
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,570
wasn't going to the expense of

476
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:26,430
replicating every single other thing

477
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,440
in that machines we're doing okay as long

478
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,410
as they had the same sort of application

479
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:37,410
visible set of chunks so most

480
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,530
replication schemes out there go the GFS

481
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,750
route in fact almost everything except

482
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,800
pretty much this paper and a few handful

483
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,750
of similar systems almost everything

484
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,220
uses application at some level

485
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,730
application level of replication because

486
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,940
it can be much more efficient because we

487
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,560
don't have to go to the we don't have to

488
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,960
go to the trouble of for example making

489
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,790
sure that interrupts occur at exactly

490
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,980
the same point in the execution of the

491
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,260
primary and backup GFS does not sweat

492
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,420
that at all but this paper has to do

493
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,340
because it replicates at such a low

494
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,520
level so most people build efficient

495
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,560
systems with applications specific

496
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,840
replication the consequence of that

497
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,880
though is that the replication has to be

498
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,900
built into the right into the

499
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,580
application right if you're getting a

500
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:26,790
feed of application level operations for

501
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,950
example you really need to have the

502
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,010
application participate in that because

503
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,720
some generic replication thing like

504
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,320
today's paper

505
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,440
doesn't really can't understand the

506
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,120
semantics of what needs to be replicated

507
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,520
so anyway so most teams are application

508
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,340
specific like GFS and every other paper

509
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,310
we're going to read on this topic

510
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:52,320
today's paper is unique in that it

511
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,420
replicates at the level of the machine

512
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,890
and therefore does not care what

513
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,870
software you run on it right it

514
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,450
replicates the low-level memory and

515
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,920
machine registers you can run any

516
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,600
software you like on it as long as it

517
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,250
runs on that kind of microprocessor

518
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,870
that's being represented this

519
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,730
replication scheme applies to the

520
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,399
software can be anything

521
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:14,080
and you know the downside is that it's

522
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,399
not that efficient necessarily the

523
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:18,559
upside is that you can take any existing

524
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,000
piece of software maybe you don't even

525
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,889
have source code for it or understand

526
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:26,029
how it works and you know do within some

527
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:27,440
limits you can just run it under this

528
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,299
under VMware's replication scheme and

529
00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:33,940
it'll just work which is sort of magic

530
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,889
fault-tolerance wand for arbitrary

531
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:44,260
software all right now let me talk about

532
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:51,230
how this is VMware FT first of all

533
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,029
VMware is a virtual machine company

534
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:56,960
they're what their business is a lot of

535
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,340
their business is selling virtual

536
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,320
machine technology and what virtual

537
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,279
machines refer to is the idea of you

538
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,269
know you buy a single computer and

539
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,289
instead of booting an operating system

540
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,289
like Linux on the hardware you boot

541
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:16,190
we'll call a virtual machine monitor or

542
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,169
hypervisor on the hardware and the

543
00:23:18,169 --> 00:23:19,669
hypervisor's job is actually to

544
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:24,429
simulate multiple multiple computers

545
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,110
multiple virtual computers on this piece

546
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,820
of hardware so the virtual machine

547
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,220
monitor may boot up you know one

548
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,580
instance of Linux may be multiple

549
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,149
instances of Linux may be a Windows

550
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:40,399
machine you can the virtual machine

551
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:42,260
monitor on this one computer can run a

552
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,470
bunch of different operating systems you

553
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,399
know each of these as is itself some

554
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:51,549
sort of operating system kernel and then

555
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,909
applications so this is the technology

556
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:58,700
they're starting with and you know the

557
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,409
reason for this is that if you know you

558
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,049
need to it just turns out there's many

559
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,760
many reasons why it's very convenient to

560
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,320
kind of interpose this level of

561
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,419
indirection between the hardware and the

562
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,039
operating systems and means that we can

563
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,899
buy one computer and run lots of

564
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,059
different operating systems on it we can

565
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:16,130
have each if we run lots and lots of

566
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,139
little services instead of having to

567
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,730
have lots and lots of computers one per

568
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,679
service you can just buy one computer

569
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,660
and run each service in the operating

570
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,850
system that it needs I'm using these

571
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,250
virtual machines so this was their

572
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,300
starting point they already had this

573
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,430
stuff and a lot of sophisticated things

574
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:35,000
built around it at the start of

575
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,690
designing vmware ft so this is just

576
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,070
virtual machines um what the paper's

577
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,910
doing is that it's gonna set up one

578
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,620
machine or they did requires two

579
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,940
physical machines because there's no

580
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,680
point in running the primary and backup

581
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,720
software in different virtual machines

582
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,400
on the same physical machine because

583
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,500
we're trying to guard against hardware

584
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,710
failures so you're gonna to at least you

585
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,900
know you have two machines running their

586
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,590
virtual machine monitors and the primary

587
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,970
is going to run on one, the backup is on

588
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,950
the other so on one of these machines we

589
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,750
have a guest you know we only it might

590
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,040
be running a lot of virtual machines we

591
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,930
only care about one of them it's gonna

592
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,670
be running some guest operating system

593
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,330
and some sort of server application

594
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,300
maybe a database server, MapReduce master,

595
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,790
or something so I'll call this the

596
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,250
primary and there'll be a second machine

597
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,490
that you know runs the same virtual

598
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,600
machine monitor and an identical virtual

599
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,580
machine holding the backup so we have

600
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,960
the same whatever the operating system

601
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,250
is exactly the same and the virtual

602
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,250
machine is you know giving these guest

603
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,170
operating systems the primary and backup

604
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:02,270
a each range of memory and this memory

605
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,760
images will be identical or the goal is

606
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,190
to make them identical in the primary in

607
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,740
the backup we have two physical machines

608
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,070
each one of them running a virtual

609
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,680
machine guest with its own copy of the

610
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,630
service we care about we're assuming

611
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,640
that there's a network connecting these

612
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,240
two machines and in addition on this

613
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,530
local area network in addition on this

614
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,480
network there's some set of clients

615
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,950
really, they don't have to be clients

616
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,160
they're just maybe other computers that

617
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,750
our replicated service needs to talk

618
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,470
with some of them are clients

619
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,270
sending requests it turns out in this

620
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:44,820
paper there the replicated service

621
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,100
actually doesn't use a local disk and

622
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,530
instead assumes that there's some sort

623
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,370
of disk server that it talks to him

624
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,309
although it's a little bit hard to

625
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:59,760
realize this from the paper the scheme

626
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,710
actually does not really treat the

627
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,140
server particularly especially it's just

628
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,289
another external source of packets and

629
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:09,929
place that the replicated state machine

630
00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:12,000
may send packets to not very much

631
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,370
different from clients okay so the basic

632
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,370
scheme is that the we assume that these

633
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:24,120
two replicas, the two virtual machines,

634
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,870
primary and backup, are exact

635
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,150
replicas some client, you know database

636
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,559
client who knows who has some client of

637
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,600
our replicated server sends a request to

638
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,080
the primary and that really takes the

639
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,909
form of a network packet that's what

640
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:40,590
we're talking about that generates an

641
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,220
interrupt

642
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,140
and this interrupt actually goes to the

643
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,270
virtual machine monitor at least in the

644
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,789
first instance the virtual machine

645
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:50,010
monitor sees here's the input for

646
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,059
this replicated service and so the

647
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,679
virtual machine monitor does two things

648
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,429
one is it sort of simulates a network

649
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:01,799
packet arrival interrupt into the

650
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,110
primary guest operating system to

651
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,470
deliver it to the primary copy of the

652
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,600
application and in addition the virtual

653
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,760
machine monitor you know knows that this

654
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,679
is an input to a replicated virtual

655
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,780
machine and it's so it sends back out on

656
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,710
the network a copy of that packet to the

657
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,010
backup virtual machine monitor it also

658
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,280
gets it and backup virtual machine

659
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,470
monitor knows ha it is a packet for this

660
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,030
particular replicated state machine and

661
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,530
it also fakes a sort of network packet

662
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,150
arrival interrupt at the backup and

663
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,090
delivers the packet so now both the

664
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,799
primary and the backup have a copy this

665
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,780
packet they looks at, the same input you

666
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,059
know with a lot of details are gonna

667
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:48,059
process it in the same way and stay

668
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,299
synchronized

669
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,100
course the service is probably going to

670
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,420
reply to the client on the primary the

671
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,030
service will generate a reply packet and

672
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,330
send it on the NIC that the virtual

673
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:06,230
machine monitor is emulating and then

674
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,550
the virtual machine monitor will

675
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,050
we'll see that output packet on the

676
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,270
primary they'll actually send the reply

677
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,930
back out on the network to the client

678
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,340
because the backup is running exactly

679
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,810
the same sequence of instructions it

680
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,360
also generates a reply packet back to

681
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,270
the client and sends that reply packet

682
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,230
on its emulated NIC it's the virtual

683
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,550
machine monitor that's emulating that

684
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:31,010
network interface card and it says aha

685
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,480
you know the virtual machine monitor

686
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,430
says I know this was the backup only the

687
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:35,990
primary is allowed to generate output

688
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,050
and the virtual machine monitor drops

689
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:42,140
the reply packet so both of them see

690
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,240
inputs and only the primary generates

691
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:53,510
outputs as far as terminology goes the

692
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:59,690
paper calls this stream of input events

693
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,400
and other things, other events we'll talk

694
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,310
about from the stream is called the

695
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,890
logging Channel it all goes over the

696
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,550
same network presumably but these events

697
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,050
the primary send to the backup are called

698
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:16,450
log events on the log Channel

699
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,740
where the fault tolerance comes in is

700
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,030
that those the primary crashes what the

701
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,490
backup is going to see is that it stops

702
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:34,040
getting stuff on the stops getting log

703
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,310
entries a log entry stops getting log

704
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:42,110
entries on the logging channel and we

705
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,500
know it it turns out that the backup can

706
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,210
expect to get many per second because

707
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,760
one of the things that generates log

708
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,370
entries is periodic timer interrupts in

709
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,310
the in the primary each one of which

710
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,290
turns out every interrupt generates a

711
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,510
log entries into the backup these timer

712
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,130
interrupts are going to happen like 100

713
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,420
times a second so the backups can

714
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,280
certainly expect to see

715
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,400
a lot of chitchat on the logging Channel

716
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,110
if the primaries up if the primary

717
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,510
crashes then the virtual machine

718
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,980
monitored over here will say gosh you

719
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,330
know I haven't received anything on the

720
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,890
logging channel for like a second or

721
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,480
however long the primary must be dead or

722
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:25,310
or something and in that case when the

723
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,700
backup stop seeing log entries from the

724
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,280
primary the paper the way the paper

725
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,320
phrases it is that the backup goes live

726
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,780
and what that means is that it stops

727
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:42,920
waiting for these input events on the

728
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,850
logging Channel from the primary and

729
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,160
instead this virtual machine monitor

730
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,790
just lets this backup execute freely

731
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,590
without waiting for without being driven

732
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:59,000
by input events from the primary the vmm

733
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,680
does something to the network to cause

734
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,510
future client requests to go to the

735
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,000
backup instead of the primary and the

736
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,770
VMM here stops discarding the backup

737
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,150
personnel it's the primary not the

738
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:13,940
backup stops discarding output from this

739
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,770
virtual machine so now this or machine

740
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,170
directly gets the inputs and there's a

741
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:20,270
lot of produce output and now our backup

742
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,520
is taken over and similarly you know

743
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,280
that this is less interesting but has to

744
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,330
work correctly

745
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,390
if the backup fails a similar primary

746
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:31,130
has to use a similar process to abandon

747
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,550
the backup stop sending it events and

748
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,100
just sort of act much more like a single

749
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,080
non replicated server so either one of

750
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,090
them can go live if the other one

751
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,460
appears to be dead stops you know stops

752
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,390
generating network traffic

753
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:57,230
magic now it depends you know depends on

754
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,550
what the networking technology is I

755
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,940
think with the paper one possibility is

756
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,910
that this is sitting on Ethernet every

757
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,530
physical computer on the Internet or

758
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:15,430
really every NIC has a 48 bit unique ID

759
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm making this up now the it could be

760
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,910
that in fact instead of each physical

761
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,400
computer having a unique ID each virtual

762
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,710
machine does and when the backup takes

763
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:36,430
over it essentially claims the primary's

764
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:39,320
Ethernet ID as its own and it starts

765
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,090
saying you know I'm the owner of that ID

766
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,620
and then other people on the ethernet

767
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,010
will start sending us packets that's my

768
00:33:46,010 --> 00:34:02,690
interpretation the designers believed

769
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,370
they had identified all such sources and

770
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:07,700
for each one of them the primary does

771
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,159
whatever it is you know executes the

772
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,139
random number generator instruction or

773
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,360
takes an interrupt at some time the

774
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,360
backup does not and the back of virtual

775
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,639
machine monitor sort of detects any such

776
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,429
instruction and and intercepts that and

777
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,560
doesn't do it and he said the backup

778
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,270
waits for an event on the logging

779
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,610
Channel saying this instruction number

780
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,980
you know the random number was whatever

781
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,700
it was on the primary

782
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,420
At which?  

783
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:42,130
yes yes

784
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,639
yeah the paper hints that they got Intel

785
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,840
to add features to the microprocessor to

786
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,650
support exactly this but they don't say

787
00:34:54,650 --> 00:35:03,370
what it was okay

788
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,090
okay so on that topic the so far that

789
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,320
you know the story is sort of assumed

790
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:16,010
that as long as the backup to sees the

791
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,450
package from the clients it'll execute

792
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:21,020
in identically to the primary and that's

793
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,310
actually glossing over some huge and

794
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:30,050
important details so one problem is that

795
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,190
as a couple of people have mentioned

796
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,710
there are some things that are

797
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,020
non-deterministic now it's not the case

798
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,430
that every single thing that happens in

799
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:39,440
the computer is a deterministic function

800
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,330
of the contents of the memory of the

801
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,420
computer it is for a sort of straight

802
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,280
line code execution often but certainly

803
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,430
not always so worried about is things

804
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,290
that may happen that are not a strict

805
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,270
function of the current state that is

806
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,920
that might be different if we're not

807
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,960
careful on the primary and backup so

808
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,760
these are sort of non-deterministic

809
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,040
events that may happen so the designers

810
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,540
had to sit down and like figure out what

811
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,570
they all work and here are the ones

812
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,350
here's the kind of stuff they talked

813
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,520
about so one is inputs from external

814
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,860
sources like clients which arrive just

815
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,420
whenever they arrive right they're not

816
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,890
predictable there are no sense in which

817
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,170
the time at which a client request

818
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,520
arrives or its content is a

819
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,080
deterministic function of the services

820
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,090
state because it's not so these actually

821
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,550
this system is really dedicated to a

822
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,550
world in which services only talk over

823
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:39,830
the network and so the only really

824
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,630
basically the only form of input or

825
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,060
output in this system is supported by

826
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,240
this system seems to be network packets

827
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,620
coming and going so we didn't put

828
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,060
arrives at what that really means it's a

829
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:50,540
packet

830
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,810
arrives and what a packet really

831
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,990
consists of for us is the data in the

832
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:01,820
packet plus the interrupt

833
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:05,570
that's signaled that the packet had

834
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,090
arrived so that's quite important so

835
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,870
when a packet arrives

836
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:16,250
I'm ordinarily the NIC DMAs the packet

837
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:20,720
contents into memory and then raises an

838
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,070
interrupt which the operating system

839
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,420
feels and the interrupt happens at some

840
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,210
point in the instruction stream and so

841
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,000
both of those have to look identical on

842
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,860
the primary and backup or else we're

843
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,050
gonna have they're also executions gonna

844
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,540
diverge and so you know the real issue

845
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,090
is when the interrupt occurs exactly at

846
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,190
which instruction the interrupts happen

847
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:42,500
to occur and better be the same on the

848
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,420
primary in the backup otherwise their

849
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,400
execution is different and their states

850
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,040
are gonna diverge and so we care about

851
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,900
the content of the packet and the timing

852
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,290
of the interrupt and then as a couple of

853
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,830
people have mentioned there's a few

854
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:04,580
instructions that that behave

855
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,920
differently on different computers or

856
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,590
differently depending on something like

857
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,300
there's maybe a random number generator

858
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,250
instruction there's I get time-of-day

859
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,260
instructions that will yield different

860
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,640
answers have called at different times

861
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,410
and unique ID instructions another huge

862
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,850
source of non determinism which the

863
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,440
paper basically rules out is multi-core

864
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,320
parallelism this is a uni-process only

865
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,910
system there's no multi-core in this

866
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,920
world the reason for this is that if it

867
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:40,340
allowed multi-core then then the service

868
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,780
would be running on multiple cores and

869
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,050
the instructions of the service the rest

870
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,890
of you know the different cores are

871
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,140
interleaved in some way which is not

872
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,810
predictable and so really if we run the

873
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,910
same code on the on the backup in the

874
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,890
server if it's parallel code running on

875
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,900
a multi-core the tube interleave the

876
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,520
instructions in the two cores in

877
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,790
different ways the hardware will and

878
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,450
that can just cause

879
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:05,910
different results because you know

880
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,850
supposing the code and the two cores you

881
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,500
know they both asked for a lock on some

882
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,050
data well on the master you know

883
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,060
core one may get the lock before core two

884
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,160
on the slave just because of a tiny

885
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,140
timing difference core two may got the

886
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,480
lock first and the you know execution

887
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,610
results are totally different likely to

888
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:25,230
be totally different if different

889
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,960
threads get the lock

890

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,060
so multi-core is the grim source among

891
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,400
non-determinisms just totally

892
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,750
outlawed in this papers world and indeed

893
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,210
like as far as I can tell the techniques

894
00:39:39,210 --> 00:40:00,000
are not really applicable the service

895
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,980
不能使用多核并行 
can't use multi-core parallel parallelism 

896
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,830
硬件几乎可以肯定是多核并行的  
the hardware is almost

897
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,960
硬件几乎可以肯定是多核并行的  
certainly multi-core parallel 

898
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,240
但那是虚拟机monitor下面的硬件 
but that's the hardware sitting underneath the

899
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,640
但那是虚拟机monitor下面的硬件 
virtual machine monitor

900
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,830
虚拟机monitor提供给guest操作系统的
the machine that the virtual machine monitor exposes to

901
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,480
虚拟机monitor提供给guest操作系统的
one of the guest operating systems that

902
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
运行primary和backup的虚拟机
runs the primary backup that emulated

903
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,000
运行primary和backup的虚拟机
virtual machine is a unicore 

904
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,080
是单核机器（在这篇论文中） 
is a uni-processor machine in this paper 

905
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,790
我猜他们没有一个简单的方法
and I'm guessing there's not an easy way for them 

906
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:31,550
可以使这种设计应用于多核虚拟机
to adapt this design to multi-core

907
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,880
可以使这种设计应用于多核虚拟机 
virtual machines

908
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,690
好的，这些是
okay so these are really

909
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:44,950
经过logging channel的这些事件  
it's these events that go over the logging channel 

910
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:49,779
日志记录的格式  
and so the format of a log record 

911
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:55,660
他们没有说清楚
a log entry they don't quite say 

912
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,160
但我猜想日志条目中要有三样东西
but I'm guessing that there's

913
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,269
但我猜想日志条目中要有三样东西 
really three things in a log entry

914
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:01,240
（一是）事件发生时的指令号
the instruction number at which

915
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,710
（一是）事件发生时的指令号  
the event occurred 

916
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,420
因为如果您要传送中断或输入，或别的
because if you're delivering an interrupt or

917
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,249
因为如果您要传送中断或输入，或别的
input or whatever it better be delivered

918
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:09,160
最好将其传送到primary和backup中完全相同的位置  
at exactly the same place in the primary and backup 

919
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,569
所以我们需要知道
so we need to know the

920
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:11,799
指令序号
instruction number and by instruction number 

921
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:14,170
指令序号的意思是
I mean the number of

922
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,910
自机器启动以来的指令数量 
instructions since the machine booted

923
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,279
而不是指令地址
not the instruction address but like

924
00:41:18,279 --> 00:41:20,650
例如，执行机器启动以来第40亿零79条指令  
oh we're executing the four billion and

925
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,499
例如，执行机器启动以来第40亿零79条指令   
79th instructions since boot 

926
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:24,609
所以日志条目将包含指令序号  
so log entry is gonna have an instruction number 

927
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:31,210
对于中断和输入
for an interrupt, for input it's

928
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,059
它将是中断在primary发生时的指令序号 
going to be the instruction at which the

929
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,769
它将是中断在primary发生时的指令序号 
interrupt was delivered on the primary

930
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:39,369
对于一个怪异指令 比如获取一天中的时间
and for a weird instruction like get time of day 

931
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:41,140
这个序号是
it's going to be the

932
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,329
获取时间的指令的指令序号  
instruction number of the instruction of

933
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,980
获取时间的指令的指令序号  
the get time of day or whatever instruction 

934
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,960
或者无论什么指令在primary上执行的序号  
that was executed on the primary 

935
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,269
这样backup就知道在哪里让此事件发生 
so that the backup

936
00:41:49,269 --> 00:41:52,450
这样backup就知道在哪里让此事件发生   
knows where to where to call this event to occur 

937
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,819
好的，（日志条目）会有type
okay so there's gonna be a type

938
00:41:54,819 --> 00:41:58,089
网络输入，或者怪异指令
network input whatever, weird instruction 

939
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:00,220
然后（日志条目）会有data
and then there's gonna be data

940
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,369
如果是有数据包到达，
for a packet arrival it's gonna

941
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:05,170
data会是包里的数据
be the packet data, for one of these

942
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:06,430
对于怪异指令，data将是这些怪异指令
weird instructions it's going to be the

943
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,140
在primary上执行后的结果  
result of the instruction 

944
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:10,450
在primary上执行后的结果  
when it was executed on the primary 

945
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,299
这样备份虚拟机就可以伪造指令
so that the backup virtual machine can sort of 

946
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,549
然后提供相同的结果
fake the instruction and supply that same

947
00:42:15,549 --> 00:42:17,910
然后提供相同的结果 
result

948
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:27,520
好的
okay so as an example the 

949
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,960
这两个操作系统，guest操作系统  
both of these operating systems guest operating system 

950
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,680
假定要求硬件
assumes requires that the

951
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,240
这里是仿真的硬件，虚拟机
hardware in this case emulated hardware

952
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,310
其计时器每秒滴答一百次 
virtual machine has a timer that ticks

953
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,680
其计时器每秒滴答一百次  
say a hundred times a second 

954
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,859
并产生中断给操作系统
and causes interrupts to the operating system and

955
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:49,540
这就是操作系统通过
that's how the operating system keeps

956
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,220
计数计时器中断来跟踪其时间的方式  
track of time it's by counting these timer interrupts 

957
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:54,700
因此
so the way that plays

958
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,500
因此计时器必须
out here, so the timers have to

959
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,270
在primary，backup中的完全相同的位置产生中断  
happen at exactly the same place in the primary and backup 

960
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,609
否则他们不会执行相同的，并且分歧
otherwise they don't

961
00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:04,089
否则他们不会执行相同的，并且分歧
execute the same and diverge 

962
00:43:04,089 --> 00:43:06,810
实际情况是
so what really happens is that

963
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,720
在运行FT虚拟机monitor的物理机上有一个计时器
there's a timer on the physical machine

964
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,140
在运行FT虚拟机monitor的物理机上有一个计时器 
that's running the FT virtual machine monitor 

965
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,060
物理机器上的计时器计时并发出中断
and the timer on the physical

966
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,250
物理机上的计时器计时并发出中断
machine ticks and delivers an interrupt

967
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,780
将计时器中断传递给primary上的虚拟机monitor
a timer interrupt to the virtual machine

968
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:23,560
将计时器中断传递给primary上的虚拟机monitor
monitor on the primary 

969
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,820
虚拟机monitor在适当的时候停止primary的执行
the virtual machine monitor at the

970
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,859
虚拟机monitor在适当的时候停止primary的执行
appropriate moment stops the execution of the primary 

971
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:31,930
记下自启动以来的指令序号
writes down the

972
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:34,180
记下自启动以来的指令序号
instruction number that it was at

973
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,320
记下自启动以来的指令序号 
instruction since boot 

974
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,790
然后以该指令编号将伪造的模拟和中断
and then delivers sort of fake emulates and

975
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,830
然后以该指令编号将伪造的模拟和中断
interrupts into the guest operating

976
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,240
提供给primary中的guest操作系统 
system in the primary at that

977
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,530
提供给primary中的guest操作系统  
instruction number 

978
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,570
你仿真的计时器硬件刚刚滴答了
saying oh you know you're emulating the timer hardware just

979
00:43:46,570 --> 00:43:47,080
有中断
ticked there's the interrupt

980
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,300
然后
and then the

981
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,400
然后primary虚拟机monitor
primary virtual machine monitor sends

982
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,599
将中断发生的指令号发送给backup
that instruction number which the

983
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,810
将中断发生的指令号发送给backup  
interrupt happened to the backup 

984
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:59,260
backup当然
the backup of course it's virtual

985
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,520
其虚拟机monitor
machine monitor is also taking timer

986
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,440
也从其物理计时器获取计时器中断  
interrupts from its physical timer 

987
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,660
并没有给提供
and it's not giving them it's not giving

988
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,910
没有把真的物理计时器中断传递给backup操作系统
its real physical timer interrupts

989
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,000
它忽略了它们  
to the backup operating system. it's just ignoring them 

990
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,450
当primary计时器中断的日志条目到达此处 
when the

991
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,700
当primary计时器中断的日志条目到达此处 
log entry for the primary's timer

992
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,730
当primary计时器中断的日志条目到达此处  
interrupts arrives here 

993
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,500
然后backup虚拟机monitor将与CPU配合
then the backup virtual machine monitor will arrange

994
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,210
这需要特殊的CPU支持
with the CPU and this requires special

995
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:28,119
这需要特殊的CPU支持
CPU support to cause the physical

996
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:30,700
以使物理机在与primary相同的指令序号处中断
machine to interrupt at the same

997
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,630
以使物理机在与primary相同的指令序号处中断
instruction number

998
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,130
以使物理机在与primary相同的指令序号处中断  
at the timer interrupts tapped into the primary 

999
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,950
此时，虚拟机monitor再次从guest操作系统取回控制 
at that point the virtual

1000
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:38,540
此时，虚拟机monitor再次从guest操作系统取回控制 
machine monitor gets control again from the guest 

1001
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,510
然后用伪造的计时器中断
and then fakes the timer

1002
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:43,970
交给backup操作系统
interrupts into the backup operating system 

1003
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,190
现在的指令号与主指令上的指令号完全相同
now exactly the same

1004
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:47,930
现在的指令号与主指令上的指令号完全相同  
instruction number as it occurred on the primary 

1005
00:44:47,930 --> 00:45:17,060
是的，这个观察是
well yeah so the observation is

1006
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,740
这依赖于CPU中有一些特殊的硬件
that this relies on the CPU

1007
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,930
这依赖于CPU中有一些特殊的硬件
having some special hardware in it 

1008
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:24,440
因此虚拟机monitor可以告诉硬件，CPU
where the vmm can tell the hardware， CPU please

1009
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:26,930
请从现在开始的第一千条指令处中断    
interrupt a thousand instructions from now 

1010
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:29,930
然后是虚拟机monitor
and then the vmm where so that 

1011
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:32,990
它会在与primary相同的指令序号处中断
it'll interrupt at the

1012
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,070
它会在与primary相同的中断序号处发生中断
right instruction number the same

1013
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,720
它会在与primary相同的中断序号处发生中断 
instruction as the primary did 

1014
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,570
然后虚拟机monitor告诉CPU
and then the vmm just tells the cpu to

1015
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,700
恢复backup的执行  
resume executing again in the backup 

1016
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,560
恰好在一千条指令之后
and exactly a thousand instructions later

1017
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,720
CPU会强制将中断虚拟机monitor
the CPU will force an interrupt into the

1018
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,460
CPU会强制将中断虚拟机monitor
virtual machine monitor 

1019
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:48,530
这是特殊的硬件
and that that's special hardware but it turns out it's

1020
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,740
但是所有英特尔芯片上有，因此它不是 
on all Intel chips so it's not

1021
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:53,930
那么特别 
it's not that special anymore

1022
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,960
放在15年前，它还挺新鲜的，现在完全是常规操作  
15 years ago it was exotic now it's totally normal 

1023
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,510
而且
and it turns out there's

1024
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:01,550
它还有很多其他用途，例如
a lot of other uses for it like um if

1025
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,930
如果您想进行性能分析
you want to do profiling you wanna do

1026
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,940
您想做CPU时间性能分析
CPU time profiling what you'd really like 

1027
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,550
执行CPU时间分析的一种方法
or one way to do CPU time profiling

1028
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,290
是让微处理器每千条指令中断一次 
is to have the microprocessor interrupt

1029
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,420
是让微处理器每千条指令中断一次  
every thousand instructions right 

1030
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,190
这里用的是相同的硬件
and this is the hardware that's this

1031
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,470
是和让微处理器每千条指令产生一个中断的相同的硬件  
Hardware also this is the same hardware

1032
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,180
是和让微处理器每千条指令产生一个中断的相同的硬件  
that would cause the microprocessor to

1033
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,860
是和让微处理器每千条指令产生一个中断的相同的硬件   
generate an interrupt every thousand instructions 

1034
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,920
所以这是你的CPU中非常自然的小工具 
so it's a very natural sort

1035
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,630
所以这是你的CPU中非常自然的小工具 
of gadget to want in your CPU

1036
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:39,170
好的，是的 
all right yes

1037
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,070
如果backup领先primary怎么办  
what if the backup gets ahead of the primary 

1038
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:59,760
我们知道
we standing above

1039
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,820
primary即将在第一百万条指令处中断 
know that the primary is

1040
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,680
primary即将在第一百万条指令处中断   
about to take an interrupt at the millionth instruction 

1041
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,970
但是备份已经执行了第一百万零一条指令
but the backup has

1042
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,760
但是备份已经执行了第一百万零一条指令
already executed the million

1043
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,010
但是备份已经执行了第一百万零一条指令
and first instruction 

1044
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,530
如果我们允许这种情况发生
if we let this happen it's gonna be too

1045
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,440
那么传递中断将为时已晚  
late to deliver the interrupts 

1046
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,240
如果我们允许backup领先primary执行 
if we let the backup execute ahead of the primary

1047
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,730
就来不及将中断放在
it's going to be too late to deliver the

1048
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,040
primary指令流和backup指令流的相同位置
interrupts at the same point in the

1049
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,510
primary指令流和backup指令流的相同位置  
primary instruction stream and the

1050
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,310
primary指令流和backup指令流的相同位置  
backup instruction stream 

1051
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,560
所以我们不能让这种情况发生
so we cannot let that happen we cannot let the

1052
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,660
我们不能让backup在执行中领先于primary  
backup get ahead of the primary in execution 

1053
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:37,860
而VMware FT实现这一亩地的方式
and the way VMware FT does

1054
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:45,450
就是backup虚拟机monitor  
that is that the backup virtual machine monitor 

1055
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,680
实际上维护一个缓冲区
actually keeps a

1056
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,680
存放来自primary的等待执行的事件
buffer of waiting events that have

1057
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,400
存放来自primary的等待执行的事件 
arrived from the primary 

1058
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,460
它不会让backup执行  
and it will not let the backup execute unless 

1059
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:58,920
除非该缓冲区中至少有一个事件
there's at least one event in that buffer 

1060
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:01,500
如果该缓冲区中有一个事件  
and if there's one event in that buffer 

1061
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,910
那么它将根据指令编号，知道强制停止backup执行的位置
then it will know from the instruction number

1062
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:07,410
那么它将根据指令编号，知道强制停止backup执行的位置
the place at which it's got a force the

1063
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,890
那么它将根据指令编号，知道强制停止backup执行的位置  
backup to stop executing 

1064
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,760
因此，任何时候当backup在执行时
so always the backup is executing with the

1065
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,420
CPU总是已经被告知下一个停止的时间点
CPU being told exactly where the next

1066
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,710
即下一个停止的指令序号
stopping point the next instruction

1067
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,720
即下一个停止的指令序号 
number of a stopping point is 

1068
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,320
只有在buffer中有事件，告诉其下一步停止的地方时
because the backup only executes if it has an

1069
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,700
backup才会执行  
event here that tells it where to stop next 

1070
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:30,450
所以这意味着它会在primary之后  
so that means it starts up after the primary 

1071
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,800
因为backup甚至不能开始执行，直到primary
because the backup can't

1072
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,570
因为backup甚至不能开始执行，直到primary
even start executing until the primary

1073
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:35,790
产生了第一个事件，并且该事件已经到达backup
has generated the first event 

1074
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,470
产生了第一个事件，并且该事件已经到达backup 
and that event has arrived at the backup 

1075
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,180
因此backup总是落后primary一个事件
so the backup sort of always one event

1076
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:41,700
落后primary至少一个事件
basically behind the at least one event

1077
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,140
落后primary至少一个事件  
behind the primary 

1078
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,730
如果由于某种原因而变慢
and if it's slower for some other whatever reason maybe

1079
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,780
可能是该物理机器上正在运行其他内容 
there's other stuff running on that

1080
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,760
可能是该物理机器上正在运行其他内容  
physical machine 

1081
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,880
那么backup可能落后primary多个事件 
then the backup might get multiple events behind

1082
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,360
那么backup可能落后primary多个事件  
the primary

1083
00:48:58,349 --> 00:49:03,099
对于到达特定数据包的情况，通常会有一点复杂 
alright there's a one little piece of

1084
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,520
对于到达特定数据包的情况，通常会有一点复杂  
mess about arriving the specific case of arriving packets 

1085
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:16,539
通常地，当一个
ordinarily when a

1086
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:17,950
数据包从网络接口卡到达  
packet arrives from a network interface card 

1087
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,299
如果我们没有运行虚拟机  
if we weren't running a virtual machine 

1088
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:22,210
网络接口卡会
the network interface card would

1089
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:24,670
通过DMA方式将数据包内容传到它所在计算机的内存中 
DMA(Direct Memory Access) the packet content into the memory

1090
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,730
通过DMA方式将数据包内容传到它所在计算机的内存中  
of the computer that it's attached to

1091
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,490
当数据从网络接口卡到达时
sort of as the data arrives from the

1092
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,069
当数据从网络接口卡到达时 
network interface card 

1093
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:34,839
你可能没有编写过这样的软件  
and that means you should never write software like this 

1094
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:38,200
但有可能，计算机上运行的操作系统
but it could be that the

1095
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,490
但可能是计算机上运行的操作系统
operating system that's running on a

1096
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:41,799
可能会看到包中的数据
computer might actually see the data of

1097
00:49:41,799 --> 00:49:44,230
当数据被从网络接口卡DMA或拷贝到内存时
a packet as its DMA or copied from the

1098
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,299
当数据被从网络接口卡DMA或拷贝到内存时 
network interface card into memory right

1099
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:49,779
我们不知道运行的是什么操作系统
this is and you know we don't

1100
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:51,010
这个系统（VMM）被设计以支持任何操作系统
know what operating this system is

1101
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:52,150
这个系统（VMM）被设计以支持任何操作系统
designed so that it can support any operating system 

1102
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,950
可能有一个操作系统
and gosh maybe there is

1103
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,039
可能有一个操作系统
an operating system that watches

1104
00:49:56,039 --> 00:49:58,779
当它们被复制到内存中时，观察到内存中到达的数据包
arriving packets in memory as they're

1105
00:49:58,779 --> 00:50:01,200
当它们被复制到内存中时，观察到内存中到达的数据包
copied into memory

1106
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,470
所以我们不能让这种情况发生
so we can't let that happen

1107
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,030
如果在主节点用的是这种方式
because if the primary happens to be playing that trick

1108
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:08,450
它就会观察到
it's gonna see

1109
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:14,850
如果我们允许网卡直接将接收到的包DMA到主节点内存
you know if we allowed the network interface card to directly DMA incoming packets into the memory of the primary

1110
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:22,900
我们没办法精确控制网卡将数据复制到内存的时间点
the primary we don't have any control over the exact timing of

1111
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:32,150
所以我们也不知道 什么时候主节点观察到网络包中的数据
and so we're not going to know sort of at what times the primary did or didn't observe data from the packet arriving

1112
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:41,720
这就意味着网卡复制包进虚拟机监视器的虚拟内存
and so what that means is that in fact the NIC copies incoming packets into private memory of the virtual machine monitor

1113
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,760
然后打断虚拟机监视器告诉它有抵达的包
and then the network interface card interrupts the virtual machine monitor and says oh a packet has arrived

1114
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,130
这时虚拟机监视器就会中断主节点
at that point the virtual machine monitor will suspend the primary

1115
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:53,850
记住当前位置的指令号
and remember what instruction number had suspended at

1116
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:01,210
在主节点中断的时候 复制整个包到主节点的内存
copy the entire packet into the primaries memory while the primary suspended and not looking at this copy

1117
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,740
然后模拟主节点的网卡中断
and then emulate a network interface card interrupt into the primary

1118
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:12,510
然后发送包和中断位置的指令号到副节点
and then send the packet and the instruction number to the backup

1119
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:16,150
副节点也会中断
the backup will also suspend the backup rope

1120
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,480
副节点也会在同样的指令号位置中断
you know virtual machine monitor will spend the backup at that instruction number

1121
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:24,720
复制整个包到副节点的内存 同样副节点中断没有注意包的抵达过程
copy the entire packet and again to the back-up is guaranteed not to be watching the data arrive

1122
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,200
然后模拟副节点在同样指令号位置中断
and then fakin interrupts at the same instruction numbers of the primary

1123
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:35,530
这就是论文中描述的回弹缓冲机制
and this is the something the bounce buffer mechanism explained in the paper

1124
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:04,920
会产生记录通道流量的指令都是不寻常的指令 很少见
okay yeah the the only instructions and that result in logging channel traffic or are weird instructions which are rare

1125
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:11,810
一般是在主节点和副节点执行结果会不同的指令
no its instructions that might yield a different result if executed on the primary and backup

1126
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,300
例如获取当前时间 获取当前处理器数量
like instruction to get the current time of day or current processor number 

1127
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,780
或者获取已执行的指令数量
or ask how many instructions have been executed or

1128
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,640
这些相对来说都是很少见的
and those actually turn out to be relatively rare

1129
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,620
或者说像生成随机数
there's also one them to get random tasks when some machines 

1130
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:27,490
让硬件生成用于加密的随机数之类的
to ask or a hardware generated random number for cryptography or something

1131
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,590
这些都不是日常的指令
and but those are not everyday instructions 

1132
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,450
大多数指令例如相加的指令会在主副节点有相同的结果
most instructions like add instructions they're gonna get the same result on primary and backup

1133
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:56,350
没错 每个网络包都被直接打包转发没有修改
exactly right each network packet just it's packaged up and forwarded as it is as a network packet

1134
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,900
由两边的TCP/IP栈进行解析
and is interpreted by the tcp/ip stack on both you know

1135
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:09,390
所以我认为99.99%的记录通道流量都是来自于接收到的包
so I'm expecting 99.99% of the logging channel traffic to be incoming packets

1136
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:15,070
只有少部分是因为会产生不确定结果的指令造成
and only a tiny fraction to be results from special non-deterministic instructions

1137
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,920
所以我们可以猜到在有客户端连接的服务器上 流量大概是什么样子的
and so we can kind of guess what the traffic load is likely to be for for a server that serves clients

1138
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,320
基本就是各个客户端发的包
basically it's a copy of every client packet

1139
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:30,920
所以我们就能估算出记录通道需要有怎样的性能
and then we'll sort of know what the logging channel how fast the logging channel has to be

1140
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,270
输出是如何工作的也值得讲一下
it's worth talking a little bit about how output works

1141
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:49,190
在这个系统中 输出就是指发送数据包
and in this system really the only what output basically means only is sending packets

1142
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:55,820
客户端发送请求的网络包 服务端响应网络包
that client send requests in as network packets the response goes back out as network packets

1143
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,700
没有其他形式的输出了
and there's really no other form of output

1144
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:04,840
主节点和副节点计算他们要发送的数据包
as I mentioned the you know both primary and backup compute the output packet they want to send

1145
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,870
在主节点上真正进行发送
and that sort of asks that simulated mix to send the packet it's really sent on the primary

1146
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,710
副节点的包则被简单地丢弃掉
and simply discard it the output packet discarded on the backup

1147
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,310
真实的情况会稍微复杂一点
okay but it turns out is a little more complicated than that

1148
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:25,840
假设我们在跑的是一个简单的数据库服务器
so supposing we're what we're running is a some sort of simple database server

1149
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:30,730
服务器支持客户端进行计数器自增（Increment)操作
and the operation the client operation that our database server supports is increment

1150
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:37,910
客户端发送自增的请求 服务端对计数器进行加操作 返回操作后的值
and ideas the client sends an increment requests the database server increments the value and sends back the new value

1151
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:42,490
假设在主节点一切都正常
so maybe on the primary well let's say everything's fine so far

1152
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:49,140
主副节点现在都存有计数器值10在内存中
and the primary backup both have value 10 in memory and that's the current value at the counter

1153
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,190
本地网络的客户端发送自增请求到主节点
and some client on the local area network sends a you know an increment request

1154
00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:04,510
这个网络包被发到主节点
to the primary that packet is you know delivered to the primary it's you know

1155
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,230
然后被主节点的程序执行
it's executed the primary server software and the primary

1156
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,610
比如说现在是10 我要将他变为11
says oh you know current values 10 I'm gonna change to 11

1157
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,590
然后产生回复告诉客户端结果11
and send a you know response packet back to the client saying saying 11

1158
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:27,110
这个请求也会被发送到副本上 将10改为11
mentioned gonna supposed to be sent to the backup will also be processed here it's going to change this 10 to 11 also

1159
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:31,100
然后同样产生一个回复 并被丢弃掉 理论上是这样
generate a reply and we'll throw it away that's what's supposed to happen the output

1160
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:39,180
然而你也要想一下如果在不恰当的时间服务出现失败会怎么样
however you also need to ask yourself what happens if there's a failure at an awkward time

1161
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,730
上这门课的期间你要一直这样问自己
if you should always in this class should always ask yourself

1162
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,580
何时出现失败是最坏的情况 这种情况下会发生什么
what's the most awkward time to have a failure and what would happen you to failure occurred then so

1163
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:59,420
假设主节点确实生成了返回给客户端的回复
suppose the primary does indeed generate the reply here back to the client

1164
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:05,810
但是主节点在发送完回复之后就宕机了
but the client the primary crashes just after sending the report its reply to the client

1165
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:12,630
更糟的是 网络向来不保证数据包能传递到接收方
and furthermore and much worse it turns out that you know this is just a network it doesn't guarantee to deliver packets

1166
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:20,520
再假设记录通道也在主节点宕机的时候失效了
let's suppose this log entry on the logging channel got dropped also when the when the primary died

1167
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:25,370
那么现在的状态就是 客户端收到回复11
so now the state of play is the client received a reply saying 11

1168
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:30,970
但是副节点没有收到转发来的客户端请求 所以计数器仍然是10
but the backup did not get the client request so its state is still 10

1169
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:38,090
现在因为察觉到主节点宕机 副节点接管服务
no now the backup takes over because it's seized the primary is dead and

1170
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:42,360
那这个或者其他客户端发送自增请求到原来的副节点
this client or maybe some other client sends an increment request a new backup

1171
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:47,570
当收到请求的时候这个接管工作的副节点开始处理
and now it's really processing these requests and so the new backup when it gets the next increment requests

1172
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,170
将计数器从10自增为11
you know it's now going to change its state to 11

1173
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:56,240
然后值11就会第二次作为回复出现
and generate a second 11 response

1174
00:56:57,210 --> 00:56:59,010
回复给原来的客户端或者不同的客户端
maybe the same client maybe to a different client

1175
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:06,110
客户端如果比较会发现这是同样的回复 这本不应该发生
which if the clients compare notes or if it's the same client it's just obviously cannot have happened I didn't

1176
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:11,380
因为我们需要支撑的程序在没改动的情况下
so you know because we have to support unmodified software that does not damn

1177
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:14,380
并不能处理这些副节点上不寻常的问题
that there's any funny business of replication going on

1178
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:17,540
意思是我们不能对它进行修改
that means we do not have the opportunity to

1179
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:19,060
比如说我们可以
you know you can imagine the client could go

1180
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,300
把客户端改成能处理
you know we could change the client to realize 

1181
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,650
副节点容错性带来的问题
something funny it happened with the fault tolerance and do I don't know what

1182
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,210
但是实际上我们没有这种选择
but we don't have that option here

1183
00:57:26,550 --> 00:57:30,490
因为这个系统只有在我们不需要客户端进行改动的情况下才有意义
because this whole system really only makes sense if we're running unmodified software

1184
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:34,930
所以这是个灾难
so so this was a big this is a disaster

1185
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,240
我们不能让它发生
we can't have let this happen does

1186
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:44,320
有人记得论文上是怎么样防止它发生的吗？
anybody remember from the paper how they prevent this from happening

1187
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:49,150
输出规则 对的
the output rule yeah so you want to do you know

1188
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,920
没错解决的方案就是控制输出规则
yeah so the output rules is the their solution to this problem

1189
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:07,240
方案就是阻止输出
and the idea is that the client he's not allowed to generate you know and

1190
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,850
在主节点上不允许生成任何输出
generate any output the primary's not allowed to generate any output

1191
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,480
比如我们现在说的这个计数器输出
and what we're talking about now is this output here

1192
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:22,330
直到副节点确认收到了所有的记录
until the backup acknowledges that it has received all log records up to this point

1193
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:28,260
所以整个流程正确的顺序是 回到主节点宕机之前
so the real sequence at the primary then let's now undone crash the primary

1194
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,600
回到计数器还是10的时候
go back to them starting at 10 the

1195
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:35,960
正确的顺序是 在这个输出规则下
real sequence now when the output rule is that

1196
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,160
当输入到来时
the input arrives at the time the input arrives

1197
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:48,540
虚拟机监视器发送输入的副本到副节点
that's when the virtual machine monitor sends a copy of the input to the backup

1198
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:53,780
这个输入的日志信息
so the the sort of time at which this log message with the input

1199
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:57,590
在主节点产生输出前发到副节点
is sent is before strictly before the primary generates the output sort of obvious

1200
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,530
发送之后这个日志就在去往副节点的网络中
then after firing this log entry off across a network and now it's heading towards the backup

1201
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:09,470
这个日志有可能丢失
but I'd have been lost might not

1202
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:17,450
虚拟机监视器同样传递请求到主节点 生成输出
the virtual machine monitor delivers a request to the primary server software it generates the output

1203
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:24,620
所以现在主节点生成结果 计数器值变为11
so now the replicated you know the primary has actually generated change the state 211

1204
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:27,250
然后产生一个11的回复
and generated an output packet that says eleven

1205
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:30,770
但是虚拟机监视器说等一下 现在还不允许生成输出
but the virtual machine monitor says oh wait a minute we're not allowed to generate that output

1206
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,470
直到之前的日志记录都被副节点确认
until all previous log records have been acknowledged by the backup

1207
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,600
这是最近的一条日志消息
so you know this is the most recent previous log message

1208
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,300
所以输出都被虚拟机监视器截停
so this output is held by the virtual machine monitor

1209
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:45,320
直到这条包含客户端输入的日志
until the this log entry containing the input packet from the client

1210
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:49,570
被虚拟机监视器投递和缓冲
is delivered to the virtual machine monitor and buffered by the virtual machine monitor 

1211
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,350
但是不一定马上会执行
but do not necessarily execute it

1212
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:55,760
可能需要等待副节点执行到指令流中对应的位置
it may be just waiting for the backup to get to that point in the instruction stream

1213
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,370
到这里虚拟机监视器就会发送一个ACK包说自己收到输入
and then the virtual machine monitor here will send an ACK packet back saying yes I did get that input

1214
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:03,350
当确认消息抵达时
and when the acknowledgment comes back

1319
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,690
only then will

1320
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:07,099
the virtual machine monitor here release

1321
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:11,270
the packet out onto the network and so

1322
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:12,980
the idea is that if the client could

1323
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,190
have seen the reply then necessarily the

1324
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:18,530
backup must have seen the request and at

1325
01:00:18,530 --> 01:00:22,579
least buffered it and so we no longer

1326
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:25,220
get this weird situation in which a

1327
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,470
client can see a reply but then there's

1328
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:29,780
a failure and a cut over and the replica

1329
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,950
didn't know anything about that reply if

1330
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:36,140
the you know there's also a situation

1331
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,310
maybe this message was lost and if this

1332
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:43,220
log entry was lost and then the primary

1333
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:45,650
crashes well since it hadn't been

1334
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,750
delivered so the backup hadn't sent the

1335
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,670
act that means if the primary crashed

1336
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:52,220
you know this log entry was brought in

1337
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:53,810
the primary crashed it must have crashed

1338
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:56,210
before the virtual machine monitor or at

1339
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:58,099
least the output packet and prayer for

1340
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:00,349
this client couldn't have gotten the

1341
01:01:00,349 --> 01:01:03,500
reply and so it's not in a position to

1342
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:09,650
spot any irregularities they're really

1343
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:12,550
happy with the output rule

1344
01:01:27,009 --> 01:01:31,599
brennon see I don't know they don't

1345
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:34,160
paper doesn't mention how the virtual

1346
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:35,719
machine monitor is implemented I mean

1347
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:38,029
it's pretty low level stuff because you

1348
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:39,529
know it's sitting there allocating

1349
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,569
memory and figuring page tables and

1350
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:43,029
talking to device drivers and

1351
01:01:43,029 --> 01:01:44,719
intercepting instructions and

1352
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,969
understanding what instructions the

1353
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,069
guest was executing so we're talking

1354
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:51,829
about low-level stuff what language is

1355
01:01:51,829 --> 01:01:53,479
written in you know traditionally C or

1356
01:01:53,479 --> 01:01:59,150
C++ but I don't actually know okay this

1357
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,449
of the primary has to delay at this

1358
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:07,400
point waiting for the backup to say that

1359
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,410
it's up to date this is a real

1360
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:12,440
performance thorn in the side of just

1361
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,440
about every replication scheme this sort

1362
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,289
of synchronous wait where the we can't

1363
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:19,999
let the primary get too far ahead of the

1364
01:02:19,999 --> 01:02:22,039
backup because if the primary failed

1365
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:24,739
while it was ahead that would be the

1366
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:27,680
backup lagging lagging behind clients

1367
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,440
right so just about every replication

1368
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,819
system has this problem that at some

1369
01:02:31,819 --> 01:02:34,459
point the primary has to stall waiting

1370
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,680
for the backup and it's a real limit on

1371
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,329
performance even if the machines are

1372
01:02:38,329 --> 01:02:40,039
like side-by-side and adjacent racks

1373
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:41,959
it's still you know we're talking about

1374
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:44,059
a half a millisecond or something to

1375
01:02:44,059 --> 01:02:45,979
send messages back and forth with a

1376
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:49,190
primary stalled and if we wanna like

1377
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:51,319
withstand earthquakes or citywide power

1378
01:02:51,319 --> 01:02:53,059
failures you know the primary in the

1379
01:02:53,059 --> 01:02:54,319
backup have to be in different cities

1380
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,589
that's probably five milliseconds apart

1381
01:02:56,589 --> 01:02:59,509
every time we produce output if we

1382
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,489
replicate in the two replicas in

1383
01:03:01,489 --> 01:03:03,349
different city every packet that it

1384
01:03:03,349 --> 01:03:05,509
produces this output has to first wait

1385
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:08,449
the five milliseconds or whatever to

1386
01:03:08,449 --> 01:03:09,949
have the last log entry get to the

1387
01:03:09,949 --> 01:03:11,449
backup and how the acknowledgment come

1388
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:12,619
back and then we can release a path

1389
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:15,289
packet and you know for sort of low

1390
01:03:15,289 --> 01:03:18,440
intensity services that's not a problem

1391
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:19,940
but if we're building a you know

1392
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,769
database server that we would like to

1393
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:22,940
you know that if it weren't for this

1394
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,190
could process millions of requests per

1395
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:25,960
second then

1396
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:28,119
that's just unbelievably damaging for

1397
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:31,660
performance and this is a big reason why

1398
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:34,569
people you know you know if they

1399
01:03:34,569 --> 01:03:38,079
possibly can use a replication scheme

1400
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,700
that's operating at a higher level and

1401
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,230
kind of understands the semantics of

1402
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:42,970
operations and so it doesn't have to

1403
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,220
stall on every packet you know it could

1404
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,740
stall on every high level operation or

1405
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,750
even notice that well you know read-only

1406
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:51,520
operations don't have to stall at all

1407
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,990
it's only right so that just all or

1408
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:54,760
something but you have to there has to

1409
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:55,839
be an application level replication

1410
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:04,569
scheme to to realize that you're

1411
01:04:04,569 --> 01:04:06,280
absolutely right so the observation is

1412
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,359
that you don't have to stall the

1413
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:08,920
execution of the primary you only have

1414
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,589
to hold the output and so maybe that's

1415
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:13,990
not as bad as it could be but

1416
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:16,150
nevertheless it means that every you

1417
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,800
know in a service that could otherwise

1418
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,510
have responded in a couple of

1419
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,390
microseconds to the client you know if

1420
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:24,940
we have to first update the replicas in

1421
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,280
the next city we turn to you know 10

1422
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,020
micro second interaction into it 10

1423
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:36,160
millisecond interactions possibly if you

1424
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,119
have vast numbers of clients submitting

1425
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:41,829
concurrent requests then you may may be

1426
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:43,690
able to maintain high throughput even

1427
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:46,180
with high latency but you have to be

1428
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:49,030
lucky to or very clever designer to get

1429
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:51,210
that

1430
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:04,280
that's a great idea but if you log in

1431
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,680
the memory of the primary that log will

1432
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,630
disappear when the primary crashes or

1433
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:10,670
that's usual semantics of a server

1434
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:13,970
failing is that you lose everything

1435
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,280
inside the box like the contents of

1436
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,790
memory or you know if even if you didn't

1437
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,680
if the failure is that somebody

1438
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,240
unplugged the power cable accidentally

1439
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,570
from the primary even if the primary

1440
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:27,920
just has battery backed up RAM or I

1441
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,710
don't know what you can't get at it

1442
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:32,740
all right the backup can't get at it so

1443
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:36,050
in fact this system does log the output

1444
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,910
and the place it logs it is in the

1445
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,980
memory of the backup and in order to

1446
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:42,320
reliably log it there you have to

1447
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,640
observe the output rule and wait for the

1448
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,130
acknowledgment so it's entirely correct

1449
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,500
idea just can't use the primary's memory

1450
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:55,030
for it yes

1451
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:06,320
say it again that's a clever idea I'd

1452
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:08,450
and so the question is maybe input

1453
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:11,570
should go to the primary but output

1454
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,770
should come from the backup

1455
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:14,600
I completely haven't thought this

1456
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,210
through that might work that

1457
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,940
I don't know that's interesting

1458
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,910
yeah maybe I will

1459
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:48,180
okay one possibility this does expose

1460
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:56,099
though is that the situation you know

1461
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,410
maybe the a primary crashes after its

1462
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:00,329
output is released so the client does

1463
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:02,760
receive the reply then the primary

1464
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,589
crashes the backups input is still in

1465
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:09,750
this event buffer in the virtual machine

1466
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:13,589
monitor of the backup it hasn't been

1467
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:15,119
delivered to the actual replicated

1468
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,809
service when the backup goes live after

1469
01:07:18,809 --> 01:07:22,049
the crash of the primary the backup

1470
01:07:22,049 --> 01:07:25,650
first has to consume all of the sort of

1471
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,539
log records that are lying around that

1472
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:29,130
it hasn't consumed yet has to catch up

1473
01:07:29,130 --> 01:07:30,960
to the primary otherwise it won't take

1474
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,240
over with the same state so before the

1475
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:34,650
backup can go live it actually has to

1476
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:37,529
consume all these entries the last entry

1477
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:41,010
is presumably is the request from the

1478
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:45,799
client so the backup will be live after

1479
01:07:45,799 --> 01:07:49,260
after it after the interrupt that

1480
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,510
delivers the request from the client and

1481
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:54,839
that means that the backup well you know

1482
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:56,819
increment its counter to eleven and then

1483
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,529
generate an output packet and since it's

1484
01:07:58,529 --> 01:08:01,859
live at this point it will generate the

1485
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:04,650
output packet and the client will get to

1486
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:10,740
eleven replies which is also if it if

1487
01:08:10,740 --> 01:08:15,660
that really happened would be anomalous

1488
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:18,689
like possibly not something that could

1489
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:22,140
happen if there was only one server the

1490
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,710
good news is that almost certainly or

1491
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,479
the almost certainly the client is

1492
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,670
talking to this service using TCP and

1493
01:08:29,670 --> 01:08:30,929
that this is the request and the

1494
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:32,279
response go back and forth on a TCP

1495
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,130
Channel the when the backup takes over

1496
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,560
the backup since the state is identical

1497
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,210
to the primaries it knows all about that

1498
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,890
TCP connection and whether all the

1499
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:43,259
sequence numbers are and whatnot and

1500
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:46,679
when it generates this packet it will

1501
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:49,589
generate it with the same TCP sequence

1502
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:52,198
number as an original packet and the TCP

1503
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:53,880
stack on the client will say oh wait a

1504
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,560
minute that's a duplicate packet

1505
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,210
we'll discard the duplicate packet at

1506
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:59,100
the TCP level and the user level

1507
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:00,450
software will just never see this

1508
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:04,470
duplicate and so this system really you

1509
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:09,000
know you can view this as a kind of

1510
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,580
accidental or clever trick but the fact

1511
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,100
is for any replication system where

1512
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,290
cutover can happen which is to say

1513
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:20,390
pretty much any replication system it's

1514
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,649
essentially impossible to design them in

1515
01:09:22,649 --> 01:09:24,930
a way that they are guaranteed not to

1516
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:29,430
generate duplicate output basically you

1517
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:31,470
know you well you can err on either side

1518
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,300
I'm not even either not generate the

1519
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:36,300
output at all which would be bad which

1520
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,979
would be terrible or you can generate

1521
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:41,010
the output twice on a cutover that's

1522
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,930
basically no way to generate it

1523
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,880
guaranteed generated only once everybody

1524
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,770
errors on the side of possibly

1525
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,770
generating duplicate output and that

1526
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:51,810
means that at some level you know the

1527
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:53,520
client side of all replication schemes

1528
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,560
need some sort of duplicate detection

1529
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,990
scheme here we get to use TCP s that we

1530
01:09:57,990 --> 01:09:59,250
didn't have TCP that would have to be

1531
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:01,140
something else maybe application level

1532
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,230
sequence numbers or I don't know what

1533
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,900
and you'll see all of this and actually

1534
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,120
you'll see versions of essentially

1535
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,590
everything I've talked about like the

1536
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:14,570
output rule for example in labs 2 & 3

1537
01:10:14,570 --> 01:10:17,820
you'll design your own replicated state

1538
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,690
machine yes

1539
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:48,030
yes to the first part so the scenario is

1540
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:51,600
the primary sends the reply and then

1541
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,010
either the primary send the close

1542
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:55,350
packet or the client closes the connect

1543
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:57,060
the TCP connection after it receives the

1544
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,920
primary's reply so now there's like no

1545
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:00,960
connection on the client side but there

1546
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,760
is a connection on the backup side and

1547
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,210
so now the backup so the backup consumes

1548
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,740
the very last log entry that as the

1549
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:10,200
input is now live so we're not

1550
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,360
responsible for replicating anything at

1551
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,760
this point right because the backup now

1552
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,980
live there's no other replica as the

1553
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,400
primary died so there's no like if if we

1554
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,460
don't if the backup fails to execute in

1555
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:24,930
log step with the primary that's fine

1556
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,550
actually because the primary is is dead

1557
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,380
and we do not want to execute in

1558
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:30,510
log step with it okay so the primer is

1559
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,690
now not it's live it generates an output

1560
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:37,500
on this TCP connection that isn't closed

1561
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,900
yet from the backup point of view this

1562
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:41,790
packet arrives with the client on a TCP

1563
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:43,140
connection that doesn't exist anymore

1564
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:45,570
from the clients point of view like no

1565
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:46,710
big whoopee on the client right he's

1566
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,510
just going to throw away the packet as

1567
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,010
if nothing happened the application

1568
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,320
won't no the client may send a reset

1569
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,570
something like a TCP error or whatever

1570
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:57,480
packet back to the backup and the backup

1571
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,620
does something or other with it but it

1572
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,660
doesn't matter because we're not

1573
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,190
diverging from anything because there's

1574
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:04,230
no primary to diverge from you can just

1575
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:08,100
handle a stray we said however it likes

1576
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,470
and what it'll in fact do is basically

1577
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:14,730
ignore but there's no now the backup has

1578
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:17,310
gone live there's just no we don't owe

1579
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:19,640
anybody anything as far as replication

1580
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,640
yeah

1581
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,100
well you can bet since the backups

1582
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:40,870
memory image is identical to the

1583
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:42,520
primaries image that they're sending

1584
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,130
packets with the very same source TCP

1585
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:48,969
number and they're very same everything

1586
01:12:48,969 --> 01:12:51,070
they're sending bit for bit identical

1587
01:12:51,070 --> 01:13:00,700
packets you know at this level the

1588
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,640
server's don't have IP addresses or for

1589
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,969
our purposes the virtual machines you

1590
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:08,230
know the primary in the back up virtual

1591
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:12,930
machines have IP addresses but the the

1592
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,340
physical computer and the vmm are

1593
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,950
transparent to the network it's not

1594
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:19,480
entirely true but it's basically the

1595
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,969
case that the virtual machine monitor in

1596
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:23,850
the physical machine don't really have

1597
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:26,940
identity of their own on the network

1598
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:29,380
because you can configure that then that

1599
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,660
way instead these they're not you know

1600
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,040
the virtual machine with a sewing

1601
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,170
operating system in its own TCP stack it

1602
01:13:35,170 --> 01:13:36,550
doesn't IP address underneath there an

1603
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:37,690
address and all this other stuff which

1604
01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:39,250
is identical between the primary in the

1605
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,080
backup and when it sends a packet it

1606
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,969
sends it with the virtual machines IP

1607
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:44,530
address and Ethernet address and those

1608
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:49,030
bits least in my mental model are just

1609
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:51,760
simply passed through on to the local

1610
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,130
area network it's exactly what we want

1611
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,840
and so I think he doesn't generate

1612
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,489
exactly the same packets that the

1613
01:13:57,489 --> 01:13:59,710
primary would have generated there's

1614
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:00,760
maybe a little bit of trickery

1615
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,340
you know what the we if this is these

1616
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,630
are actually plugged into an Ethernet

1617
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,730
switch into the physical machines maybe

1618
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:08,860
it wasn't in two different ports of an

1619
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:09,969
Ethernet switch and we'd like the

1620
01:14:09,969 --> 01:14:12,480
Ethernet switch to change its mind about

1621
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,530
which of these two machines that

1622
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:18,790
delivers packets with replicated

1623
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,950
services Ethernet address and so there's

1624
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:23,710
a little bit of funny business there for

1625
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:24,910
the most part they're just generating

1626
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:26,260
identical packets so let me just send

1627
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:28,500
them out

1628
01:14:29,550 --> 01:14:33,650
okay so another little detail I've been

1629
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:36,810
glossing over is that I've been assuming

1630
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,970
that the primary just fails or the

1631
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:41,790
backup just fails that is fail stop

1632
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,320
right but that's not the only option

1633
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:46,350
another very common situation that has

1634
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:49,770
to be dealt with is if the two machines

1635
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:51,390
are still up and running and executing

1636
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:53,190
but there's something funny happen on

1637
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:56,640
the network that causes them not to be

1638
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,110
able to talk to each other but to still

1639
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:01,740
be able to talk to some clients so if

1640
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,510
that happened if the primary backup

1641
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:05,100
couldn't talk to each other but they

1642
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,330
could still talk to the clients they

1643
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:07,920
would both think oh the other replicas

1644
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,140
dead I better take over and go live and

1645
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:12,450
so now we have two machines going live

1646
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:14,220
with this service and now you know

1647
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:16,470
they're no longer sending each other log

1648
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,430
events or anything they're just

1649
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,350
diverging maybe they're accepting

1650
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:21,330
different client inputs and changes are

1651
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,590
stayed in different ways so now we have

1652
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,930
a split brain disaster if we let the

1653
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,080
primary in the backup go live because it

1654
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,360
was a network that has some kind of

1655
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,230
failure instead of these machines and

1656
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:36,380
the way that this paper solves it I mean

1657
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:41,910
is by appealing to an outside authority

1658
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:44,250
to make the decision about which of the

1659
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:46,140
primary of the backup is allowed to be

1660
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:53,340
live and so it they're you know it turns

1661
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:54,600
out that their storage is actually not

1662
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,700
on local disk this almost doesn't matter

1663
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,980
but their storage is on some external

1664
01:15:58,980 --> 01:16:01,920
disk server and as well as being in this

1665
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,570
server as a like totally separate

1666
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,160
service there's nothing to do with disks

1667
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:07,050
there this server happens to abort this

1668
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:15,090
test and set test and set service over

1669
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:17,280
the network where you you can send a

1670
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,860
test and set request to it and there's

1671
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:21,930
some flag it's keeping in memory and

1672
01:16:21,930 --> 01:16:23,250
it'll set the flag and return what the

1673
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,590
old value was so both primary and backup

1674
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:28,890
have to sort of acquire this test and

1675
01:16:28,890 --> 01:16:30,450
set flag it's a little bit like a lock

1676
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,640
in order to go live they both may be

1677
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,920
send test and set requests at the same

1678
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:37,320
time to this test and set server the

1679
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:39,360
first one gets back a reply that says oh

1680
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,550
the flag used to be zero now it's one

1681
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:42,310
this

1682
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:44,740
second request to arrive the response

1683
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:46,090
from the test and set server is Oh

1684
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:47,680
actually the flag was already one when

1685
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,200
your request arrived so so basically

1686
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:52,720
you're not allowed to be primary and so

1687
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,660
this this test and set server and we can

1688
01:16:55,660 --> 01:16:58,810
think of it as a single machine is the

1689
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:00,700
arbitrator that decides which of the two

1690
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:02,740
should go live if they both think the

1691
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,870
other ones dead due to a network

1692
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:08,920
partition any questions about this

1693
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:17,830
mechanism you're busted yeah if the test

1694
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,750
and set server should be dead at the

1695
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,960
critical moment when and so actually

1696
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,640
even if there's not a network partition

1697
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,370
under all circumstances in which one or

1698
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:28,480
the other of these wants to go live

1699
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:30,280
because it thinks the others dead even

1700
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:32,500
when the other one really is dead the

1701
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:33,850
one that wants to collide still has to

1702
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,350
acquire the test and set lock because

1703
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:39,100
one of like the deep rules of 6.824

1704
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:43,630
game is that you cannot tell whether or

1705
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,850
another computer is dead or not all you

1706
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,110
know is that you stopped receiving

1707
01:17:47,110 --> 01:17:49,360
packets from it and you don't know

1708
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,500
whether it's because the other computer

1709
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,920
is dead or because something has gone

1710
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,420
wrong with the network between you and

1711
01:17:55,420 --> 01:17:57,340
the other computer so all the backup

1712
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,230
ceases well I've stuck in packets maybe

1713
01:17:59,230 --> 01:18:00,720
the primary is dead maybe it's live

1714
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:03,670
primary probably sees the same thing so

1715
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:04,660
if there's a network partition they

1716
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,920
certainly have to ask the Test-and-Set

1717
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,210
server but since they don't know if it's

1718
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:08,950
a network partition they have to ask the

1719
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:11,830
test and set server regardless of whether

1720
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:13,870
it's a partition or not so anytime

1721
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:15,970
either wants to collide the test and set

1722
01:18:15,970 --> 01:18:17,650
server also has to be alive because they

1723
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:19,780
always have to acquire this test and set

1724
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:22,900
lock so the test and set server

1725
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,220
sounds like a single point of failure

1726
01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:26,320
they were trying to build a replicated

1727
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:29,260
fault tolerant whatever thing but in the

1728
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:30,820
end you know we can't failover unless

1729
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:35,740
unless this is alive so that's a bit of

1730
01:18:35,740 --> 01:18:36,270
a bummer

1731
01:18:36,270 --> 01:18:39,520
I'm guessing though I'm making a strong

1732
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,410
guess that the test and set server is

1733
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:44,590
actually itself a replicated service and

1734
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,840
is fault tolerant right it's almost

1735
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:49,030
certainly I mean these people of VMware

1736
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:50,770
where they're like happy to sell you a

1737
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:53,560
million dollar highly available storage

1738
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,840
system that

1739
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:56,760
uses enormous amounts of replication

1740
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,250
internally um since the test and set

1741
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,869
thing is on there dis server I'm I'm

1742
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:03,389
guessing it's replicated too and the

1743
01:19:03,389 --> 01:19:05,219
stuff you'll be doing in lab 2 in lab 3

1744
01:19:05,219 --> 01:19:07,770
is more than powerful enough for you to

1745
01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:11,040
build your own fault-tolerant test and

1746
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,110
set server so this problem can easily be

1747
01:19:13,110 --> 00:00:00,000
eliminated
