1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,640
I'd like to get started today we're

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,389
gonna talk about GFS the Google file

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:10,980
system paper we read for today

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,660
and this will be the first of a number

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,540
of different sort of case studies we'll

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,160
talk about in this course about how to

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,410
be build big storage systems so the

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:29,310
larger topic is big storage the reason

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,410
is the storage is turned out to be a key

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,260
abstraction you might you know if you

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,850
didn't know already you might imagine

12
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,230
that there could be all kinds of

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,050
different you know important

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,030
abstractions you might want to use for

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,650
distributed systems but it's turned out

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,730
that a simple storage interface is just

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,010
incredibly useful and extremely general

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,480
and so a lot of the thought that's gone

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,280
into building distributed systems has

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,170
either gone into designing storage

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,630
systems or designing other systems that

22
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,180
assume underneath them some sort of

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,989
reasonably well behaved big just

24
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,519
distributed storage system so we're

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,500
going to care a lot about how the you

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,360
know how to design a good interface to a

27
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,420
big storage system and how to design the

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,159
innards of the storage system so it has

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,030
good behavior you know of course that's

30
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,229
why we're reading this paper just to get

31
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,850
a start on that the this paper also

32
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,530
touches on a lot of themes that will

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,900
come up a lot in a tube for parallel

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,060
performance fault tolerance replication

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,740
and consistency and this paper is as

36
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,140
such things go reasonably

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,390
straightforward and easy to understand

38
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,670
it's also a good systems paper it sort

39
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,560
of talks about issues all the way from

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,229
the hardware to the software that

41
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,960
ultimately uses the system and it's a

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,320
successful real world design so it says

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,030
you know academic paper published in an

44
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,189
academic conference but it describes

45
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,890
something that really was successful and

46
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,030
used for a long time in the real world

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,650
so we sort of know that we're talking

48
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,340
about something that is it's a good a

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,110
good useful design okay so before I'm

50
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,149
gonna talk about GFS I want to sort of

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,279
talk about the space of distributed

52
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:13,030
storage systems a little bit

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,810
set the scene so first why is it hard

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,560
it's actually a lot to get right but for

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,900
a 2/4 there's a particular sort of

56
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,330
narrative that's gonna come up quite a

57
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,140
lot for many systems often the starting

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,180
point for people designing these sort of

59
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,890
big distributed systems or big storage

60
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,330
systems is they want to get huge

61
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,340
aggregate performance be able to harness

62
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,090
the resources of hundreds of machines in

63
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,620
order to get a huge amount of work done

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,000
so the sort of starting point is often

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,430
performance and you know if you start

66
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,010
there a natural next thought is well

67
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,019
we're gonna split our data over a huge

68
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:00,640
number of servers in order to be able to

69
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,420
read many servers in parallel so we're

70
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,769
gonna get and that's often called

71
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:11,160
sharding if you shard over many servers

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,600
hundreds or thousands of servers you're

73
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,970
just gonna see constant faults right if

74
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,140
you have thousands of servers there's

75
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,680
just always gonna be one down so we

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,540
the faults are just every day every hour

77
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,250
occurrences and we need automatic

78
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,350
we can't have human involved and fixing

79
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,890
this fault we need automatic

80
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,290
fault-tolerant systems so that leads to

81
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,090
fault tolerance the among the most

82
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,920
powerful ways to get fault tolerance is

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,630
with replication just keep two or three

84
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,190
or whatever copies of data one of them

85
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,390
fails you can use another one so we want

86
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,010
to have tolerance that leads to

87
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,100
replication if you have replication two

88
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,470
copies the data then you know for sure

89
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,329
if you're not careful they're gonna get

90
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,010
out of sync and so what you thought was

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,750
two replicas of the data where you could

92
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,549
use either one interchangeably to

93
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,170
tolerate faults if you're not careful

94
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,670
what you end up with is two almost

95
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,640
identical replicas of the data that's

96
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,289
like not exactly replicas at all and

97
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,180
what you get back depends on which one

98
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,039
you talk to so that's starting to maybe

99
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:25,240
look a little bit

100
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,420
tricky for applications to use so if we

101
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:34,330
have replication we risk weird

102
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,800
inconsistencies of course clever design

103
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,400
you can get rid of inconsistency and

104
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,680
make the data look very well-behaved but

105
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,450
if you do that it almost always requires

106
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,210
extra work and extra sort of chitchat

107
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,140
between all the different servers and

108
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,610
clients in the network that reduces

109
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,470
performance so if you want consistency

110
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:09,190
you pay for with low performance I which

111
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,740
is of course not what we originally

112
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,420
hoping for of course this is an absolute

113
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,650
you can build very high performance

114
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,990
systems but nevertheless there's this

115
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,480
sort of inevitable way that the design

116
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,370
of these systems play out and it results

117
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,670
in a tension between the original goals

118
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,920
of performance and the sort of

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,020
realization that if you want good

120
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,720
consistency you're gonna pay for it and

121
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,730
if you don't want to pay for it then you

122
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,830
have to suffer with sort of anomalous

123
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,930
behavior sometimes I'm putting this up

124
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,840
because we're gonna see this this loop

125
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,310
many times for many of the systems we

126
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,580
look we look at people are rarely

127
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,070
willing to or happy about paying the

128
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,930
full cost of very good consistency ok so

129
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,520
you know with brought a consistency I'll

130
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,050
talk more later in the course about more

131
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,000
exactly what I mean by good consistency

132
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
but you can think of strong consistency

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,280
or good consistency as being we want to

134
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,410
build a system whose behavior to

135
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,930
applications or clients looks just like

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,610
you'd expect from talking to a single

137
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,760
server all right we're gonna build you

138
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,260
know systems out of hundreds of machines

139
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,170
but a kind of ideal strong consistency

140
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,000
model would be what you'd get if there

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
was just one server with one copy of the

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,810
data doing one thing at a time so this

143
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,349
is kind of a strong

144
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:41,169
consistency kind of intuitive way to

145
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,789
think about strong consistency so you

146
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:45,490
might think you have one server we'll

147
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,020
assume that's a single-threaded server

148
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,210
and that it processes requests from

149
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,919
clients one at a time and that's

150
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:52,569
important because there may be lots of

151
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:55,509
clients sending concurrently requests

152
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:57,370
into the server and see some current

153
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,020
requests it picks one or the other to go

154
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,729
first and excuse that request to

155
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:04,090
completion then excuse the nets so for

156
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,099
storage servers or you know the server's

157
00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:07,629
got a disk on it and what it means to

158
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,060
process a request is it's a write

159
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,610
request you know which might be writing

160
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,710
an item or may be increment and I mean

161
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,979
incrementing an item if it's a mutation

162
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,069
then we're gonna go and we have some

163
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:23,680
table of data and you know maybe index

164
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
by keys and values and we're gonna

165
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,039
update this table and if the request

166
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,240
comes in and to read we're just gonna

167
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,099
you know pull the write data out of the

168
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:36,759
table one of the rules here that sort of

169
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:39,580
makes this well-behaved is that each is

170
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,740
that the server really does execute in

171
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,710
our simplified model excuse to request

172
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,129
one at a time and that requests see data

173
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,990
that reflects all the previous

174
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,819
operations in order so if a sequence of

175
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,560
writes come in and the server process

176
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,360
them in some order then when you read

177
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,060
you see the sort of you know value you

178
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,009
would expect if those writes that

179
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:05,169
occurred one at a time the behavior this

180
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,029
is still not completely straightforward

181
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,659
there's some you know there's some

182
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,919
things that you have to spend at least a

183
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,629
second thinking about so for example if

184
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:19,539
we have a bunch of clients and client

185
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:25,180
one issues a write of value X and wants

186
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,460
it to set it to one and at the same time

187
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,460
client two issues the right of the same

188
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,159
value but wants to set it to a different

189
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,360
the same key but wants to set it to a

190
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,860
different value right

191
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,409
something happens let's say client three

192
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,490
reads and get some result or client

193
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,020
three after these writes complete reads

194
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,220
get some result client four

195
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,290
reads X and get some also gets a result

196
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,999
so what results should the two clients

197
00:08:51,999 --> 00:09:00,959
see yeah

198
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,200
well that's a good question so these

199
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,060
what I'm assuming here is that client

200
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,770
one inclined to launch these requests at

201
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,720
the same time so if we were monitoring

202
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,190
the network we'd see two requests

203
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,500
heading to the server at the same time

204
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,710
and then sometime later the server would

205
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,520
respond to them

206
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,790
so there's actually not enough here to

207
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,070
be able to say whether the client would

208
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,530
receipt would process the first request

209
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,780
first which order there's not enough

210
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,880
here to tell which order the server

211
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,460
processes them in and of course if it

212
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,580
processes this request first then that

213
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,760
means or it processes the right with

214
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
value to second and that means that

215
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,350
subsequent reads have to see two where is

216
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,030
it the server happened to process this

217
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,250
request first and this one's second that

218
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,020
means the resulting value better be one

219
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,060
and these these two requests and see one

220
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,670
so I'm just putting this up to sort

221
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,950
of illustrate that even in a simple

222
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,230
system there's ambiguity you can't

223
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,020
necessarily tell from trace of what went

224
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,190
into the server or what should come out

225
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,820
all of you can tell is that some set of

226
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,250
results is consistent or not consistent

227
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,470
with a possible execution so certainly

228
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,850
there's some completely wrong results we

229
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,060
can see go by it you know if client 3

230
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,030
sees a 2 then client 4 I bet had better

231
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,210
see a two also because our model is

232
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,040
well after the second write you know

233
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,750
client tree sees it two that means

234
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,870
this write must have been second and it

235
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,700
still had better be it still has to have

236
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,620
been the second write one client 4 goes

237
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,220
to the date so hopefully all this is

238
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,410
just completely straightforward and just

239
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,790
as expected because it's it's supposed

240
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,200
to be the intuitive model of strong

241
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,190
consistency ok and so the problem with

242
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,300
this of course is that a single server

243
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,370
has poor fault tolerance right if it

244
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,840
crashes or it's disk dies or something

245
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,870
we're left with nothing and so in the

246
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,520
real world of distributed systems we

247
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,430
actually build replicated systems so and

248
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,930
that's where all the problems start

249
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,220
leaking in is when we have a second

250
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,060
copying data so here is what must be

251
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,180
close to the worst replication design

252
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,220
and I'm doing this to warn you of the

253
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,810
problems that we will then be looking

254
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,960
for in GFS all right so here's a bad

255
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:30,380
replication design we're gonna have two

256
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,630
servers now each with a complete copy of

257
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,510
the data and so on disks that are both

258
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,730
gonna have this this table of keys and

259
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,810
values the intuition of course is that

260
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,090
we want to keep these tables we hope to

261
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,880
keep these tables identical so that if

262
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,650
one server fails we can read or write

263
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,720
from the other server and so that means

264
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,490
that somehow every write must be

265
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,210
processed by both servers and reads have

266
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,890
to be able to be processed by a single

267
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,570
server otherwise it's not fault tolerant

268
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,280
all right if reads have to consult both

269
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,940
and we can't survive the loss of one of

270
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:13,160
the servers okay so the problem is gonna

271
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,030
come up well I suppose we have client 1

272
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,190
and client 2 and they both want to do

273
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,570
these write say one of them gonna write

274
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,250
one and the other is going to write two

275
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,790
so client 1 is gonna launch it's write

276
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,270
x1 2 both because we want to update both

277
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,600
of them and clent 2 is gonna launch it's

278
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:41,800
write X so what's gonna go wrong here

279
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,280
yeah yeah we haven't done anything here

280
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,410
to ensure that the two servers process

281
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,590
the two requests in the same order right

282
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,930
that's a bad design

283
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,800
so if server 1 processes client ones

284
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,100
request first it'll end up it'll start

285
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,600
with a value of 1 and then it'll see

286
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,610
client twos request and overwrite that

287
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,610
with 2 if server 2 just happens to

288
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,350
receive the packets over the network in

289
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,020
a different order it's going to execute

290
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,310
client 2's requests and set the value to

291
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,350
2 and then then it will see client ones

292
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,140
request set the value to 1 and now what

293
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,450
a client a later reading client sees you

294
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,760
know if client 3 happens to reach from

295
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,520
this server and client for happens to

296
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,720
reach from the other server then we get

297
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,610
into this terrible situation where

298
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,320
they're gonna read different values even

299
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,410
though our intuitive model of a correct

300
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,990
service says they both subsequent reads

301
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,589
have to yeild the same value and this can

302
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,930
arise in other ways you know suppose we

303
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,579
try to fix this by making the clients

304
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,920
always read from server one if it's up

305
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,829
and otherwise server two if we do that

306
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:51,350
then if this situation happened and four

307
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,089
why oh yeah both everybody reads might

308
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,279
see client might see value too but a

309
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,649
server one suddenly fails then even

310
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,290
though there was no right suddenly the

311
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,050
value for X we'll switch from 2 to 1

312
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,850
because if server 1 died it's all the

313
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,130
clients assistant server 2 no but just

314
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,079
this mysterious change in the data that

315
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:11,570
doesn't correspond to any right which is

316
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,190
also totally not something that could

317
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,680
have happened in this service simple

318
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,329
server model all right so of course this

319
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,940
can be fixed the fix requires more

320
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:28,220
communication usually between the

321
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,529
servers or somewhere more complexity and

322
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:36,649
because of the cost of inevitable cost

323
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,820
to the complexity to get strong

324
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,180
consistency there's a whole range of

325
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,610
different solutions to get better

326
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:45,769
consistency and a whole range of what

327
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:48,350
people feel is an acceptable level of

328
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,250
consistency in an acceptable sort of a

329
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,890
set of anomalous behaviors that might be

330
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:57,560
revealed all right any questions about

331
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,910
this disastrous model here

332
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:07,779
okay that's what you're talking about

333
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:13,209
GFS a lot of thought about doing GFS was

334
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,079
doing is fixing this they had better but

335
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,790
not perfect behavior okay so where GFS

336
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,179
came from in 2003 quite a while ago

337
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:27,730
actually at that time the the web you

338
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,379
know was certainly starting to be a very

339
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,569
big deal and people are building big

340
00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:35,439
websites in addition there had been

341
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,540
decades of research into distributed

342
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,009
systems and people sort of knew at least

343
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,509
at the academic level how to build all

344
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:43,119
kinds of highly parallel fault tolerant

345
00:15:43,119 --> 00:15:44,739
whatever systems but there been very

346
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:49,589
little use of academic ideas in industry

347
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:52,239
but starting at around the time this

348
00:15:52,239 --> 00:15:54,759
paper was published big websites like

349
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,399
Google started to actually build serious

350
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,569
distributed systems and it was like very

351
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,699
exciting for people like me who were on

352
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,879
academic side of this to see see real

353
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,119
uses of these ideas where Google was

354
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:11,769
coming from was you know they had some

355
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,470
vast vast data sets far larger than

356
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,360
could be stored in a single disk like an

357
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,769
entire crawl copy of the web or a little

358
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:22,119
bit after this paper they had giant

359
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,480
YouTube videos they had things like the

360
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,669
intermedia files for building a search

361
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:28,299
index

362
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,790
they also apparently kept enormous log

363
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,679
files from all their web servers so they

364
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,029
could later analyze them so they had

365
00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,910
some big big data sets they used both to

366
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,339
store them and many many disks to store

367
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:41,139
them and they needed to be able to

368
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:42,399
process them quickly with things like

369
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,709
MapReduce so they needed high speed

370
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,529
parallel access to these vast amounts of

371
00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,819
data okay so what they were looking for

372
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:53,669
one goal was just that the thing be big

373
00:16:53,669 --> 00:17:00,009
and fast they also wanted a file system

374
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,470
that was sort of global in the sense

375
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,148
that many different applications could

376
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,490
get at it one way to build a big storage

377
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,990
system is to you know you have some

378
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,398
particular application or mining you

379
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,260
build storage sort of dedicated and

380
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,119
tailored to that application and if

381
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,829
somebody else in the next office needs

382
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,079
big storage well they can build their

383
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,680
own thing

384
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,099
right but if you have a universal server

385
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:25,300
kind of global reusable storage system

386
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,030
and that means that if I store a huge

387
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,710
amount of data si you know I'm crawling

388
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,600
the web and you want to look at my

389
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,290
crawled web web pages because we're all

390
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,580
using we're all playing in the same

391
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,740
sandbox we're all using the same storage

392
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,750
system you can just read my files you

393
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:43,480
know maybe access controls permitting so

394
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,190
the idea was to build a sort of file

395
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,110
system where anybody you know anybody

396
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,080
inside Google could name and read any of

397
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,010
the files to allow sharing in order to

398
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,540
get a in order to get bigness and

399
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,300
fastness they need to split the data

400
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,990
through every file will be automatically

401
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,900
split by GFS over many servers so that

402
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,950
writes and reads would just

403
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,780
automatically be fast as long as you

404
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,730
were reading from lots and lots of

405
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,770
reading a file from lots of clients you

406
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,860
get high aggregate throughput and also

407
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,230
be able to for a single file be able to

408
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,670
have single files that were bigger than

409
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,730
any single disk because we're building

410
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,170
something out of hundreds of servers we

411
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:36,430
want automatic feel your recovery we

412
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,480
don't want to build a system where every

413
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,860
time one of our hundreds of servers a

414
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,540
fail some human being has to go to the

415
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,490
machine room and do something with the

416
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,830
server or to get it up and running or

417
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,870
transfers data or something well this

418
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,130
isn't just fix itself um there were some

419
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,370
sort of non goals like one is that GFS

420
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,930
was designed to run in a single data

421
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,340
center so we're not talking about

422
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,950
placing replicas all over the world a

423
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,410
single GFS installation just lived in

424
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,200
one one data center one big machine run

425
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:12,190
so getting this style system to work

426
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,860
where the replicas are far distant from

427
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,550
each other is a valuable goal but

428
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:22,720
difficult so single data centers this is

429
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,540
not a service to customers GFS was for

430
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,920
internal use by

431
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,210
applications written by Google engineers

432
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,400
so it wasn't they weren't directly

433
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,810
selling this they might be selling

434
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,170
services they used GFS internally but

435
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,520
they weren't selling it directly so it's

436
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,660
just for internal use and it was

437
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,630
tailored in a number of ways for big

438
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,180
sequential file reads and writes there's

439
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,180
a whole nother domain like a system of

440
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,490
storage systems that are optimized for

441
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,590
small pieces of data like a bank that's

442
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,090
holding bank balances probably wants a

443
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,100
database that can read and write an

444
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,380
update you know 100 byte records that

445
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,230
hold people's bank balances but GFS is

446
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,230
not that system so it's really for big

447
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,600
or big is you know terabytes gigabytes

448
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,350
some big sequential not random access

449
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,690
it's also that has a certain batch

450
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,340
flavor there's not a huge amount of

451
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,840
effort to make access be very low

452
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
latency the focus is really on

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,880
throughput of big you know multi

454
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,780
megabyte operations this paper was

455
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,560
published at SOSP in 2003 the top

456
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:46,860
system's academic conference yeah usually

457
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,080
the standard for papers such conferences

458
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,260
they have you know a lot of very novel

459
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:54,060
research this paper was not necessarily

460
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,920
in that class the specific ideas in this

461
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,750
paper none of them are particularly new

462
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,990
at the time and things like distribution

463
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,510
and sharding and fault tolerance were

464
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,340
you know well understood had to had to

465
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,620
deliver those but this paper described a

466
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,480
system that was really operating in in

467
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,970
use at a far far larger scale hundreds

468
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,680
of thousands of machines much bigger

469
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,400
than any you know academics ever built

470
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
the fact that it was used in industry

471
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,450
and reflected real world experience of

472
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,370
like what actually didn't didn't work

473
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,490
for deployed systems that had to work

474
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,950
and had to be cost effective also like

475
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:34,080
extremely valuable the paper sort of

476
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,090
proposed a fairly heretical view that it

477
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,800
was okay for the storage system to have

478
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,270
pretty

479
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,440
consistency we the academic mindset at

480
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,550
that time was the you know the storage

481
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,780
system really should have good behavior

482
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,830
like what's the point of building

483
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,780
systems that sort of return the wrong

484
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,750
data like my terrible replication system

485
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,400
like why do that why not build systems

486
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,020
return the right data correct data

487
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,240
instead of incorrect data now with this

488
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,570
paper actually does not guarantee return

489
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,960
correct data and you know the hope is

490
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,130
that they take advantage of that in

491
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,440
order to get better performance I'm a

492
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,900
final thing that was sort of interesting

493
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,580
about this paper is its use of a single

494
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,370
master in a sort of academic paper you

495
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,020
probably have some fault-tolerant

496
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,900
replicated automatic failure recovering

497
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,110
master perhaps many masters with the

498
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,550
work split open um but this paper said

499
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,960
look you know you they can get away with

500
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:39,260
a single master and it worked fine well

501
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,610
cynically you know who's going to notice

502
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,010
on the web that some vote count or

503
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,920
something is wrong or if you do a search

504
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,510
on a search engine now you're gonna know

505
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,480
that oh you know like one of 20,000

506
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,890
items is missing from the search results

507
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,860
or they're in the wrong order probably

508
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,130
not so there was just much more

509
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,510
tolerance in these kind of systems than

510
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,210
there would like in a bank for incorrect

511
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,070
data it doesn't mean that all data and

512
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,630
websites can be wrong like if you're

513
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,880
charging people for ad impressions you

514
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,890
better get the numbers right but this is

515
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:15,830
not really about that in addition some

516
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,370
of the ways in which GFS could serve up

517
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,770
odd data could be compensated for in the

518
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,540
applications like where the paper says

519
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,490
you know applications should accompany

520
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,040
their data with checksums and clearly

521
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,260
mark record boundaries that's so the

522
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,380
applications can recover from GFS

523
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,480
serving them maybe not quite the right

524
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,690
data

525
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,730
all right so the general structure and

526
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,840
this is just figure one in the paper so

527
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,850
we have a bunch of clients hundreds

528
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,920
hundreds of clients we have one master

529
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:02,040
although there might be replicas of the

530
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:07,140
master the master keeps the mapping from

531
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,510
file names to where to find the data

532
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,980
basically although there's really two

533
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,100
tables so and then there's a bunch of

534
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,390
chunk servers maybe hundreds of chunk

535
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,090
servers each with perhaps one or two

536
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,640
discs the separation here's the master

537
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,320
is all about naming and knowing where

538
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,480
the chunks are and the chunk servers

539
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,400
store the actual data this is like a

540
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,020
nice aspect of the design that these two

541
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,760
concerns are almost completely separated

542
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,880
from each other and can be designed just

543
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,700
separately with separate properties the

544
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,170
master knows about all the files for

545
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,970
every file the master keeps track of a

546
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,260
list of chunks chunk identifiers that

547
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,880
contain the successive pieces that file

548
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,400
each chunk is 64 megabytes so if I have

549
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,090
a you know gigabyte file the master is

550
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:58,590
gonna know that maybe the first chunk is

551
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:00,059
stored here and the second chunk is

552
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,559
stored here the third chunk is stored

553
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,780
here and if I want to read whatever part

554
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,490
of the file I need to ask the master oh

555
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,260
which server hole is that chunk and I go

556
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,000
talk to that server and read the chunk

557
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:17,130
roughly speaking all right so more

558
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,150
precisely we need to turns out if we're

559
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,190
going to talk about how the system about

560
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,690
the consistency of the system and how it

561
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,360
deals with fault we need to know what

562
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,100
the master is actually storing in a

563
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,770
little bit more detail so the master

564
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,190
data

565
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,900
it's got two main tables that we care

566
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,360
about it's got one table that map's file

567
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:52,460
name to an array of chunk IDs or chunk

568
00:25:52,460 --> 00:26:00,830
handles this just tells you where to

569
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,050
find the data or what the what the

570
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,030
identifiers are the chunks are so it's

571
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,620
not much yet you can do with a chunk

572
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,840
identifier but the master also happens

573
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,440
to have a a second table that map's

574
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,570
chunk handles each chunk handle to a

575
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,110
bunch of data about that chunk so one is

576
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,330
the list of chunk servers that hold

577
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,900
replicas of that data each chunk is

578
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,040
stored on more than one chunk server so

579
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:39,650
it's a list of chunk servers every chunk

580
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:42,400
has a current version number so this

581
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,610
master has a remembers the version

582
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:50,150
number for each chunk all writes for a

583
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,950
chunk have to be sequence of the chunks

584
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,910
primary it's one of the replicas so

585
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:58,880
master remembers the which chunk server's

586
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,980
the primary and there's also that

587
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,570
primary is only allowed to be primary

588
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,450
for a certain lease time so the master

589
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,370
remembers the expiration time of the

590
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,240
lease this stuff so far it's all in RAM

591
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,670
and the master so just be gone if the

592
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:24,530
master crashed so in order that you'd be

593
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,570
able to reboot the master and not forget

594
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:29,150
everything about the file system the

595
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,710
master actually stores all of this data

596
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:35,180
on disk as well as in memory so reads

597
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,270
just come from memory but writes to at

598
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,490
least the parts of this data that had to

599
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,140
be reflected on this writes have to go

600
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:45,500
to the disk so and the way it actually

601
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,510
managed that is that there's all

602
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,290
the master has a log on disk and every

603
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,750
time it changes the data it appends an

604
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,380
entry to the log on disk and checkpoint

605
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,220
so some of this stuff actually needs to

606
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,600
be on disk and some doesn't it turns out

607
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,980
I'm guessing a little bit here but

608
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,190
certainly the array of chunk handles has

609
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,050
to be on disk and so I'm gonna write env

610
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,510
here for non-volatile meaning it it's

611
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:22,850
got to be reflected on disk the list of

612
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,610
chunk servers it turns out doesn't

613
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,370
because the master if it reboots talks

614
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,720
to all the chunk servers and ask them

615
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,710
what chunks they have so this is I

616
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,290
imagine not written to disk the version

617
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,450
number any guesses written to disk not

618
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,950
written to disk requires knowing how the

619
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:51,830
system works I'm gonna vote written to

620
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,790
disk non-volatile we can argue about

621
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,500
that later when we talk about how system

622
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:04,790
works identity the primary it turns out

623
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,560
not almost certainly not written to disk

624
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,640
so volatile and the reason is the master

625
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,010
is um reboots and forgets therefore

626
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,680
since it's volatile forgets who the

627
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,330
primary is for a chunk it can simply

628
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:19,910
wait for the 60-second lease expiration time

629
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,920
and then it knows that absolutely no

630
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,540
primary will be functioning for this

631
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,920
chunk and then it can designate a

632
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,020
different primary safely and similarly

633
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,660
the lease expiration stuff is volatile

634
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,840
so that means that whenever a file is

635
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,030
extended with a new chunk goes to the

636
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,100
next 64 megabyte boundary or the version

637
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,710
number changes because the new primary

638
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,740
is designated that means that the master

639
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,440
has to first append a little record to

640
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,900
his log basically saying oh I just added

641
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,510
a such-and-such a chunk to this file or

642
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,420
I just changed the version number so

643
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,530
every time I change is one of those that

644
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,360
needs to writes right it's disk so this

645
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,830
is paper doesn't talk about this

646
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,870
much but you know there's limits the

647
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:05,090
rate at which the master can change

648
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,039
things because you can only write your

649
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,340
disk however many times per second and

650
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,950
the reason for using a log rather than a

651
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,279
database you know some sort of b-tree or

652
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,179
hash table on disk is that you can

653
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:23,980
append a log very efficiently because

654
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,600
you only need you can take a bunch of

655
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,309
recent log records they need to be added

656
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:29,539
and sort of write them all on a single

657
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:32,149
write after a single rotation to

658
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,649
whatever the point in the disk is that

659
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:36,080
contains the end of the log file whereas

660
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,899
if it were a sort of b-tree reflecting

661
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,080
the real structure of this data then you

662
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,370
would have to seek to a random place in

663
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,169
the disk and do a little right so the

664
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:46,519
log makes a little bit faster to write

665
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,620
there to reflect operations on to the

666
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,570
disk however if the master crashes and

667
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,789
has to reconstruct its state you

668
00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:00,409
wouldn't want to have to reread its log

669
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:02,570
file back starting from the beginning of

670
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,159
time from when the server was first

671
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,559
installed you know a few years ago so in

672
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,870
addition the master sometimes

673
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,940
checkpoints its complete state to disk

674
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:15,110
which takes some amount of time seconds

675
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:17,779
maybe a minute or something and then

676
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,210
when it restarts what it does is goes

677
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,860
back to the most recent checkpoint and

678
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,620
plays just the portion of a log that

679
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,480
sort of starting at the point in time

680
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,019
when that check one is created any

681
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:39,340
questions about the master data okay

682
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,029
so with that in mind I'm going to lay

683
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,340
out the steps in a read and the steps in

684
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:46,879
the right

685
00:31:46,879 --> 00:31:49,129
where all this is heading is that I then

686
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:50,960
want to discuss you know for each

687
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,840
failure I can think of why does the

688
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,389
system or does the system act directly

689
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,639
after that failure um but in order to do

690
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:00,740
that we need to understand the data and

691
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,470
operations in the data okay so if

692
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:11,210
there's a read the first step is that

693
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,980
the client and what a read means that

694
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,749
the application has a file name in mind

695
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,450
and an offset in the file that it wants

696
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,279
to read some data front so it sends the

697
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:21,799
file name and the offset to the master

698
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:23,869
and the master looks up the file name in

699
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:25,759
its file table and then you know each

700
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,309
chunk is 64 megabytes who can use the

701
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:30,889
offset divided by 64 megabytes to find

702
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:33,649
which chunk and then it looks up that

703
00:32:33,649 --> 00:32:39,409
chunk in its chunk table finds the list

704
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,869
of chunk servers that have replicas of

705
00:32:41,869 --> 00:32:44,509
that data and returns that list to the

706
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:52,249
client so the first step is so you know

707
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:56,809
the file name and the offset the master

708
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:05,720
and the master sends the chunk handle

709
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,450
let's say H and the list of servers so

710
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:13,070
now we have some choice we can ask any

711
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,590
one of these servers pick one that's and

712
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,990
the paper says that clients try to guess

713
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,429
which server is closest to them in the

714
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:23,360
network maybe in the same rack and send

715
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,279
the read request to that to that replica

716
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,649
the client actually caches

717
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,930
caches this result so that if it reads

718
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,820
that chunk again and indeed the client

719
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,560
might read a given chunk in you know one

720
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,550
megabyte pieces or 64 kilobyte pieces or

721
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,620
something so I may end up reading the

722
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,410
same chunk different points successive

723
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,730
regions of a chunk many times and so

724
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:56,050
caches which server to talk to you for

725
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:57,310
giving chunks so it doesn't have to keep

726
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,020
beating on the master asking the master

727
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:02,550
for the same information over and over

728
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:07,330
now the client talks to one of the chunk

729
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,880
servers tells us a chunk handling offset

730
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,540
and the chunk servers store these chunks

731
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,060
each chunk in a separate Linux file on

732
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,340
their hard drive in a ordinary Linux

733
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,699
file system and presumably the chunk

734
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:26,800
files are just named by the handle so

735
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,659
all the chunk server has to do is go

736
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:31,210
find the file with the right name you

737
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,449
know I'll give it that

738
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,560
entire chunk and then just read the

739
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,130
desired range of bytes out of that file

740
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:46,570
and return the data to the client I hate

741
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,909
question about how reads operate can I

742
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:54,370
repeat number one the step one is the

743
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,880
application wants to read it a

744
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,040
particular file at a particular offset

745
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,890
within the file a particular range of

746
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,420
bytes in the files and one thousand two

747
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,830
two thousand and so it just sends a name

748
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,010
of the file and the beginning of the

749
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:12,160
byte range to the master and then the

750
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,050
master looks a file name and it's file

751
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:18,610
table to find the chunk that contains

752
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:23,820
that byte range for that file so good

753
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,119
[Music]

754
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,500
so I don't know the exact details my

755
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
impression is that the if the

756
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,309
application wants to read more than 64

757
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:42,319
megabytes or even just two bytes but

758
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:44,779
spanning a chunk boundary that the

759
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:47,869
library so the applications linked with

760
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,099
a library that sends our pcs to the

761
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,230
various servers and that library would

762
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,690
notice that the reads spanned a chunk

763
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,490
boundary and break it into two separate

764
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,039
reads and maybe talk to the master I

765
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,480
mean it may be that you could talk to

766
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,069
the master once and get two results or

767
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:06,710
something but logically at least it two

768
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,269
requests to the master and then requests

769
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:19,609
to two different chunk servers yes well

770
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:21,650
at least initially the client doesn't

771
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,829
know for a given file

772
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:35,990
what chunks need what chunks well it can

773
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,720
calculate it needs the seventeenth chunk

774
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,130
but but then it needs to know what chunk

775
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,109
server holds the seventeenth chunk of

776
00:36:42,109 --> 00:36:44,839
that file and for that it certainly

777
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:47,599
needs for that it needs to talk to the

778
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:58,490
master okay so all right did I'm not

779
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,839
going to make a strong claim about which

780
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:01,130
of them decides that it was the

781
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,170
seventeenth chunk in the file but it's

782
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,380
the master that finds the identifier of

783
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,849
the handle of the seventeenth chunk in

784
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,950
the file looks that up in its table and

785
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:12,589
figures out which chunk servers hold

786
00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:17,349
that chunk yes

787
00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:35,480
how does that or you mean if the if the

788
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,010
client asks for a range of bytes that

789
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:46,400
spans a chunk boundary yeah so the the

790
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,049
well you know the client will ask that

791
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,490
well the clients linked with this

792
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,950
library is a GFS library that noticed

793
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:56,190
how to take read requests apart and put

794
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,270
them back together and so that library

795
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,290
would talk to the master and the master

796
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,910
would tell it well well you know chunk

797
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,130
seven is on this server and chunk eight

798
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,589
is on that server and then why the

799
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:09,270
library would just be able to say oh you

800
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,859
know I need the last couple bites of

801
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,240
chunk seven and the first couple bites

802
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,420
of chunk eight and then would fetch

803
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,819
those put them together in a buffer and

804
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:21,980
return them to the calling application

805
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,530
well the master tells it about chunks

806
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,900
and the library kind of figures out

807
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,700
where it should look in a given chunk to

808
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,950
find the date of the application wanted

809
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,240
the application only thinks in terms of

810
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,609
file names and sort of just offsets in

811
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:41,280
the entire file in the library and the

812
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,200
master conspire to turn that into chunks

813
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,500
yeah

814
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:55,400
sorry let me get closer here you say

815
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,289
again so the question is does it matter

816
00:39:03,289 --> 00:39:06,109
which chunk server you read from so you

817
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,929
know yes and no notionally they're all

818
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:13,039
supposed to be replicas in fact as you

819
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:14,869
may have noticed or as we'll talk about

820
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:17,209
they're not you know they're not

821
00:39:17,209 --> 00:39:20,689
necessarily identical and applications

822
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:21,979
are supposed to be able to tolerate this

823
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,779
but the fact is that you make a slightly

824
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,829
different data depending on which

825
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,999
replicas you read yeah so the paper says

826
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:32,420
that clients try to read from the chunk

827
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,699
server that's in the same rack or on the

828
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:44,749
same switch or something all right so

829
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:47,229
that's reads

830
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:51,420
the writes are more complex and

831
00:39:51,420 --> 00:40:02,880
interesting now the application

832
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,410
interface for writes is pretty similar

833
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,030
there's just some call some library you

834
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:08,910
call to make you make to the gfs client

835
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,230
library saying look here's a file name

836
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,540
and a range of bytes I'd like to write

837
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,339
and the buffer of data that I'd like you

838
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,609
to write to that that range actually let

839
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,530
me let me backpedal I only want to talk

840
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,099
about record appends and so I'm going to

841
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:26,339
praise this the client interface as the

842
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,200
client makes a library call that says

843
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,940
here's a file name and I'd like to

844
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,069
append this buffer of bytes to the file

845
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:35,099
I said this is the record appends that

846
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:42,900
the paper talks about so again the

847
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,579
client asks the master look I want to

848
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:49,680
append sends a master requesting what I

849
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,240
would like to append this named file

850
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,140
please tell me where to look for the

851
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,790
last chunk in the file because the

852
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,619
client may not know how long the file is

853
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,329
if lots of clients are appending the

854
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,819
same file because we have some big file

855
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,950
this logging stuff from a lot of

856
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,900
different clients may be you know no

857
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,369
client will necessarily know how long

858
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:10,380
the file is and therefore which offset

859
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,270
or which chunk it should be appending to

860
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,280
so you can ask the master please tell me

861
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,680
about the the server's that hold the

862
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,710
very last chunk

863
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,550
current chunk in this file so

864
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:26,040
unfortunately now the writing if you're

865
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,569
reading you can read from any up-to-date

866
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:30,060
replica for writing though there needs

867
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,760
to be a primary so at this point on the

868
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,579
file may or may not have a primary

869
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,710
already designated by the master so we

870
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,180
need to consider the case of if there's

871
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,980
no primary already and all the master

872
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:49,560
knows well there's no primary so so one

873
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,119
case is no primary

874
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,099
in that case the master needs to find

875
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:03,430
out the set of chunk servers that have

876
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,339
the most up-to-date copy of the chunk

877
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:08,470
because know if you've been running the

878
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,660
system for a long time due to failures

879
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,800
or whatever there may be chunk servers

880
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,290
out there that have old copies of the

881
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,579
chunk from you know yesterday or last

882
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,950
week that I've been kept up to kept up

883
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,690
to date because maybe that server was

884
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:21,819
dead for a couple days and wasn't

885
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,800
receiving updates so there's you need to

886
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,730
be able to tell the difference between

887
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:27,190
up-to-date copies of the chunk and non

888
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:33,569
up-to-date so the first step is to find

889
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:37,510
you know find up-to-date this is all

890
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:41,319
happening in the master because the

891
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:42,790
client has asked the master told the

892
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,260
master look I want up end of this file

893
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,180
please tell me what chunk service to

894
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,550
talk to so a part of the master trying

895
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,780
to figure out what chunk servers the

896
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,680
client should talk to you

897
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,950
so when we finally find up-to-date

898
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:59,770
replicas and what update means is a

899
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,260
replica whose version of the chunk is

900
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,720
equal to the version number that the

901
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,730
master knows is the most up-to-date

902
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,140
version number it's the master that

903
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,630
hands out these version numbers the

904
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,740
master remembers that oh for this

905
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,460
particular chunk you know the trunk

906
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,569
server is only up to date if it has

907
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:21,220
version number 17 and this is why it has

908
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,550
to be non-volatile stored on disk

909
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:26,560
because if if it was lost in a crash and

910
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,000
there were chunk servers holding stale

911
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,670
copies of chunks the master wouldn't be

912
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:35,140
able to distinguish between chunk

913
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,819
servers holding stale copies of a chunk

914
00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:39,310
from last week and a chunk server that

915
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:42,250
holds the copy of the chunk that was

916
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,440
up-to-date as of the crash that's why

917
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,660
the master remembers the version number on

918
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:49,470
disk yeah

919
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,859
if you knew you were talking to all the

920
00:43:56,859 --> 00:43:59,970
chunk servers okay so the observation is

921
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,260
the master has to talk to the chunk

922
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,660
servers anyway if it reboots in order to

923
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:06,280
find which chunk server holds which

924
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,890
chunk because the master doesn't

925
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:12,150
remember that so you might think that

926
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,380
you could just take the maximum you

927
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,579
could just talk to the chunk servers

928
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:17,079
find out what trunks and versions they

929
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:19,000
hold and take the maximum for a given

930
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,619
chunk overall the responding chunk

931
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:22,750
servers and that would work if all the

932
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,579
chunk servers holding a chunk responded

933
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:26,920
but the risk is that at the time the

934
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,480
master reboots maybe some of the chunk

935
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,400
servers are offline or disconnected or

936
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,770
whatever themselves rebooting and don't

937
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,349
respond and so all the master gets back

938
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:38,200
is responses from chunk servers that

939
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,119
have last week's copies of the block and

940
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:42,460
the chunk servers that have the current

941
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:44,320
copy haven't finished rebooting or

942
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:54,940
offline or something so ok oh yes if if

943
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:56,619
the server's holding the most recent

944
00:44:56,619 --> 00:44:59,859
copy are permanently dead if you've lost

945
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:02,980
all copies all of the most recent

946
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,540
version of a chunk then yes

947
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,130
No

948
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,339
okay so the question is the master knows

949
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,560
that for this chunk is looking for

950
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,550
version 17

951
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,579
supposing it finds no chunk server you

952
00:45:21,579 --> 00:45:22,690
know and it talks to the chunk servers

953
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,430
periodically to sort of ask them what

954
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,780
chunks do you have what versions you

955
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,520
have supposing it finds no server with

956
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,369
chunk 17 with version 17 for this this

957
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:32,800
chunk then the master will either say

958
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,710
well either not respond yet and wait or

959
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,790
it will tell the client look I can't

960
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,880
answer that try again later and this

961
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,530
would come up like there was a power

962
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,849
failure in the building and all the

963
00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:47,079
server's crashed and we're slowly

964
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:49,510
rebooting the master might come up first

965
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,430
and you know some fraction of the chunk

966
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,079
servers might be up and other ones would

967
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,609
reboot five minutes from now but so we

968
00:45:57,609 --> 00:45:59,890
ask to be prepared to wait and it will

969
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:02,290
wait forever because you don't want to

970
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,440
use a stale version of that of a chunk

971
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,190
okay so the master needs to assemble the

972
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:10,540
list of chunk servers that have the most

973
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,910
recent version the master knows the most

974
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:14,619
recent versions stored on disk each

975
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:16,540
chunk server along with each chunk as

976
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,280
you pointed out also remembers the

977
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,810
version number of the chunk that it's

978
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:22,540
stores so that when chunk slivers

979
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,859
reported into the master saying look I

980
00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:25,690
have this chunk the master can ignore

981
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,760
the ones whose version does not match

982
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,339
the version the master knows is the most

983
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:34,869
recent okay so remember we were the

984
00:46:34,869 --> 00:46:36,670
client want to append the master doesn't

985
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,579
have a primary it figures out maybe you

986
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:42,310
have to wait for the set of chunk

987
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,960
servers that have the most recent

988
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:49,020
version of that chunk it picks a primary

989
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,930
so I'm gonna pick one of them to be the

990
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,109
primary and the others to be secondary

991
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:56,859
servers

992
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,210
among the replicas set at the most

993
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:02,140
recent version the master then

994
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,859
increments

995
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:11,170
the version number and writes that to

996
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,600
disk so it doesn't forget it the crashes

997
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,970
and then it sends the primary in the

998
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,700
secondaries and that's each of them a

999
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,710
message saying look for this chunk

1000
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:22,840
here's the primary here's the

1001
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,650
secondaries you know recipient maybe one

1002
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,450
of them and here's the new version

1003
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:32,170
number so then it tells primary

1004
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:37,060
secondaries this information plus the

1005
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,490
version number the primaries and

1006
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:39,970
secondaries

1007
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,920
alright the version number to disk so

1008
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,780
they don't forget because you know if

1009
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,040
there's a power failure or whatever they

1010
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,140
have to report in to the master with the

1011
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:51,210
actual version number they hold yes

1012
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,190
that's a great question

1013
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,500
so I don't know there's hints in the

1014
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,170
paper that I'm slightly wrong about this

1015
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:14,740
so the paper says I think your question

1016
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,030
was explaining something to me about the

1017
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,310
paper the paper says if the master

1018
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:22,480
reboots and talks to chunk servers and

1019
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,220
one of the chunk servers reboot reports

1020
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,530
a version number that's higher than the

1021
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,540
version number the master remembers the

1022
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,600
master assumes that there was a failure

1023
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,600
while it was assigning a new primary and

1024
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,760
adopts the new the higher version number

1025
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,860
that it heard from a chunk server so it

1026
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,250
must be the case that in order to handle

1027
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:48,010
a master crash at this point that the

1028
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:55,869
master writes its own version number to

1029
00:48:55,869 --> 00:49:02,530
disk after telling the primaries there's

1030
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:03,550
a bit of a problem here though because

1031
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:11,880
if the was that is there an ACK

1032
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:17,250
all right so maybe the master tells the

1033
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,810
primaries and backups and that their

1034
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:20,400
primaries and secondaries if they're a

1035
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,720
primary secondary tells him the new

1036
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,450
version number waits for the AK and then

1037
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,870
writes to disk or something unsatisfying

1038
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:37,770
about this I don't believe that works

1039
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,380
because of the possibility that the

1040
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,940
chunk servers with the most recent

1041
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:44,190
version numbers being offline at the

1042
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,650
time the master reboots we wouldn't want

1043
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,360
the master the master doesn't know the

1044
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,610
current version number it'll just accept

1045
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,960
whatever highest version number adheres

1046
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,300
which could be an old version number all

1047
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,000
right so this is a an area of my

1048
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,260
ignorance I don't really understand

1049
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,570
whether the master update system version

1050
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,800
number on this first and then tells the

1051
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,600
primary secondary or the other way

1052
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,360
around and I'm not sure it works either

1053
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,340
way okay but in any case one way or

1054
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,810
another the master update is version

1055
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,340
number tells the primary secondary look

1056
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,140
your primaries and secondaries here's a

1057
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,700
new version number and so now we have a

1058
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:19,410
primary which is able to accept writes

1059
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,480
all right that's what the primaries job

1060
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,730
is to take writes from clients and

1061
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,760
organize applying those writes to the

1062
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:35,130
various chunk servers and you know the

1063
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,450
reason for the version number stuff is

1064
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:44,270
so that the master will recognize the

1065
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,940
which servers have this new you know the

1066
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,800
master hands out the ability to be

1067
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,320
primary for some chunk server we want to

1068
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,950
be able to recognize if the master

1069
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,260
crashes you know that it was that was

1070
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,840
the primary that only that primary and

1071
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:05,070
it secondaries which were actually

1072
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,720
processed which were in charge of

1073
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,250
updating that chunk that only those

1074
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,530
primaries and secondaries are allowed to

1075
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,630
be chunk servers in the future and the

1076
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:14,070
way the master does this is with this

1077
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,270
version number logic

1078
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,500
okay so the master tells the primaries

1079
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,119
and secondaries that there it they're

1080
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,740
allowed to modify this block it also

1081
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:27,530
gives the primary a lease which

1082
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:29,390
basically tells the primary look you're

1083
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,099
allowed to be primary for the next sixty

1084
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:33,200
seconds after sixty Seconds you have to

1085
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,280
stop and this is part of the machinery

1086
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,290
for making sure that we don't end up

1087
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,869
with two primaries I'll talk about a bit

1088
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:46,339
later okay so now we were primary now

1089
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:50,089
the master tells the client who the

1090
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:54,440
primary and the secondaries are and at

1091
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,050
this point we're we're executing in

1092
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:02,240
figure two in the paper the client now

1093
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,040
knows who the primary secondaries are in

1094
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:05,660
some order or another and the paper

1095
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,180
explains a sort of clever way to manage

1096
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,849
this in some order or another the client

1097
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:13,250
sends a copy of the data it wants to be

1098
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:15,230
appended to the primary in all the

1099
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:18,440
secondaries and the primary in the

1100
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,390
secondaries write that data to a

1101
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,099
temporary location it's not appended to

1102
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,380
the file yet after they've all said yes

1103
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,180
we have the data the client sends a

1104
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,130
message to the primary saying look you

1105
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,470
know you and all the secondaries have

1106
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,569
the data I'd like to append it for this

1107
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,579
file

1108
00:52:36,579 --> 00:52:38,960
the primary maybe is receiving these

1109
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,520
requests from lots of different clients

1110
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,010
concurrently it picks some order execute

1111
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:45,260
the client request one at a time and for

1112
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,260
each client appends request the primary

1113
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,450
looks at the offset that's the end of

1114
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:53,030
the file the current end of the current

1115
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:54,740
chunk makes sure there's enough

1116
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,480
remaining space in the chunk and then

1117
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,960
tells then writes the clients record to

1118
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,240
the end of the current chunk and tells

1119
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,369
all the secondaries to also write the

1120
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:08,359
clients data to the end to the same

1121
00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:12,010
offset the same offset in their chunks

1122
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:20,500
all right so the primary picks an offset

1123
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:26,480
all the replicas including the primary

1124
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,180
are told to write

1125
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:36,090
the new appended record at at offset the

1126
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:38,700
secondary's they may do it they may not

1127
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,250
do it I'm either run out of space maybe

1128
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:42,810
they crashed maybe the network message

1129
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:45,480
was lost from the primary so if a

1130
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,970
secondary actually wrote the data to its

1131
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,760
disk at that offset it will reply yes to

1132
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,859
the primary if the primary collects a

1133
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:57,740
yes answer from all of the secondaries

1134
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,190
so if they all of all of them managed to

1135
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:03,630
actually write and reply to the primary

1136
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:08,250
saying yes I did it then the primary is

1137
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,800
going to reply reply success to the

1138
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:18,930
client if the primary doesn't get an

1139
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,510
answer from one of the secondaries or

1140
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,580
the secondary reply sorry something bad

1141
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,590
happened I ran out of disk space my disk

1142
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,980
I don't know what then the primary

1143
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:37,950
replies no to the client and the paper

1144
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,420
says oh if the client gets an error like

1145
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:42,000
that back in the primary the client is

1146
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,369
supposed to reissue the entire append

1147
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:46,020
sequence starting again talking to the

1148
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:48,530
master to find out the most grease the

1149
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,369
chunk at the end of the file

1150
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:52,500
I want to know the client supposed to

1151
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,300
reissue the whole record append

1152
00:54:54,300 --> 00:55:01,650
operation ah you would think but they

1153
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:05,180
don't so the question is jeez you know

1154
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:08,220
the the primary tells all the replicas

1155
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,869
to do the append yeah maybe some of them

1156
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:10,830
do some of them don't

1157
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,869
right if some of them don't then we

1158
00:55:12,869 --> 00:55:14,460
apply an error to the client so the

1159
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,109
client thinks of the append in happen

1160
00:55:16,109 --> 00:55:18,630
but those other replicas where the append

1161
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:23,550
succeeded they did append so now we have

1162
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:25,400
replicas donor the same data one of them

1163
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,480
the one that returned in error didn't do

1164
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,890
the append and the ones they returned

1165
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:31,830
yes did do the append so that is just

1166
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,119
the way GFS works

1167
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:47,590
yeah so if a reader then reads this file

1168
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,330
they depending on what replica they be

1169
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:53,360
they may either see the appended record

1170
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,810
or they may not if the record append

1171
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:59,120
but if the record append succeeded if

1172
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,920
the client got a success message back

1173
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,920
then that means all of the replicas

1174
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,420
appended that record at the same offset

1175
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:10,160
if the client gets a no back then zero

1176
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,090
or more of the replicas may have

1177
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:15,740
appended the record of that all set and

1178
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,240
the other ones not so the client got to

1179
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,280
know then that means that some replicas

1180
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,130
maybe some replicas have the record and

1181
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,860
some don't so what you which were

1182
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,750
roughly read from you know you may or

1183
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,980
may not see the record yeah

1184
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:45,319
oh that all the replicas are the same

1185
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,240
all the secondaries are the same version

1186
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,430
number so the version number only

1187
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,500
changes when the master assigns a new

1188
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,900
primary which would ordinarily happen

1189
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:55,309
and probably only happen if the primary

1190
00:56:55,309 --> 00:56:58,270
failed so what we're talking about is is

1191
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:00,200
replicas that have the fresh version

1192
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,660
number all right and you can't tell from

1193
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,740
looking at them that they're missing

1194
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:08,059
that the replicas are different but

1195
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:09,319
maybe they're different and the

1196
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:11,390
justification for this is that yeah you

1197
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,160
know maybe the replicas don't all have

1198
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,099
that the appended record but that's the

1199
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,200
case in which the primary answer no to

1200
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,180
the clients and the client knows that

1201
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,940
the write failed and the reasoning

1202
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,410
behind this is that then the client

1203
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,859
library will reissue the append so the

1204
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,480
appended record will show up you know

1205
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,260
eventually the append succeed you

1206
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:36,920
would think because the client I'll keep

1207
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,480
reissuing it until succeeds and then

1208
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,770
when it succeeds that means there's

1209
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,510
gonna be some offset you know farther on

1210
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:43,460
in the file where that record actually

1211
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,859
occurs in all the replicas as well as

1212
00:57:45,859 --> 00:57:48,049
offsets preceding that word only occurs

1213
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:52,690
in a few of the replicas yes

1214
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:11,779
oh this is a great question

1215
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:15,690
the exact path that the right data takes

1216
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,910
might be quite important with respect to

1217
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:19,410
the underlying network and the paper

1218
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:22,950
somewhere says even though when the

1219
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:24,539
paper first talks about it he claims

1220
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:26,490
that the client sends the data to each

1221
00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:29,309
replica in fact later on it changes the

1222
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:31,289
tune and says the client sends it to

1223
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:33,539
only the closest of the replicas and

1224
00:58:33,539 --> 00:58:36,359
then the replicas then that replica

1225
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:37,829
forwards the data to another replica

1226
00:58:37,829 --> 00:58:39,630
along I sort of chained until all the

1227
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,940
replicas had the data and that path of

1228
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,770
that chain is taken to sort of minimize

1229
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,859
crossing bottleneck inter switch links

1230
00:58:46,859 --> 00:59:00,390
in a data center yes the version number

1231
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:03,539
only gets incremented if the master

1232
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,119
thinks there's no primary so it's a so

1233
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,359
in the ordinary sequence there already

1234
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:13,710
be a primary for that chunk the the

1235
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:16,680
the the master sort of will remember oh

1236
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,180
gosh there's already a primary and

1237
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,470
secondary for that chunk and it'll just

1238
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,640
it won't go through this master

1239
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,079
selection it won't increment the version

1240
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,450
number it'll just tell the client look

1241
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:26,400
up here's the primary with with no

1242
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,270
version number change

1243
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:47,090
my understanding is that if this is this

1244
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,130
I think you're asking a you're asking an

1245
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,050
interesting question so in this scenario

1246
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,940
in which the primaries isn't answered

1247
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:54,590
failure to the client you might think

1248
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,000
something must be wrong with something

1249
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,860
and that it should be fixed before you

1250
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:59,870
proceed in fact as far as I can tell the

1251
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:03,320
paper there's no immediate anything the

1252
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:08,300
client retries the append you know

1253
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,010
because maybe the problem was a network

1254
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,570
message got lost so there's nothing to

1255
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,980
repair right you know now we're gonna

1256
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,850
message got lost we should be

1257
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,080
transmitted and this is sort of a

1258
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,600
complicated way of retransmitting the

1259
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,040
network message maybe that's the most

1260
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,020
common kind of failure in that case just

1261
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,790
we don't change anything it's still the

1262
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:26,750
same primary same secondaries the client

1263
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,130
we tries maybe this time it'll work

1264
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,270
because the network doesn't

1265
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:31,490
discard a message it's an interesting

1266
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,900
question though that if what went wrong

1267
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,510
here is that one of that there was a

1268
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,910
serious error or Fault in one of the

1269
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:41,150
secondaries what we would like is for

1270
01:00:41,150 --> 01:00:43,880
the master to reconfigure that set of

1271
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,820
replicas to drop that secondary that's

1272
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,460
not working and it would then because

1273
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,900
it's choosing a new primary in executing

1274
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,610
this code path the master would then

1275
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,890
increment the version and then we have a

1276
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,750
new primary and new working secondaries

1277
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:00,170
with a new version and this not-so-great

1278
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,720
secondary with an old version and a

1279
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,160
stale copy of the data but because that

1280
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,000
has an old version the master will never

1281
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,260
never mistake it for being fresh but

1282
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,640
there's no evidence in the paper that

1283
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,470
that happens immediately as far as

1284
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,110
what's said in the paper the client just

1285
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:17,180
retries and hopes it works again later

1286
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,610
eventually the master will if the

1287
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,230
secondary is dead

1288
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:23,990
eventually the master does ping all the

1289
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,850
trunk servers will realize that and will

1290
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:30,770
probably then change the set of

1291
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,090
primaries and secondaries and increment

1292
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,590
the version but only only later

1293
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:45,660
the lease the leases that the answer to

1294
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:49,890
the question what if the master thinks

1295
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,500
the primary is dead because it can't

1296
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,790
reach it right that's supposing we're in

1297
01:01:53,790 --> 01:01:55,470
a situation where at some point the

1298
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,110
master said you're the primary and the

1299
01:01:58,110 --> 01:01:59,940
master was like painting them all the

1300
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,260
service periodically to see if they're

1301
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:02,610
alive because if they're dead and wants

1302
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:05,160
to pick a new primary the master sends

1303
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,080
some pings to you you're the primary and

1304
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,690
you don't respond right so you would

1305
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:11,850
think that at that point where gosh

1306
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:14,060
you're not responding to my pings then

1307
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,560
you might think the master at that point

1308
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:20,790
would designate a new primary it turns

1309
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:23,820
out that by itself is a mistake and the

1310
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,130
reason for that the reason why it's a

1311
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:30,090
mistake to do that simple did you know

1312
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,400
use that simple design is that I may be

1313
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,870
pinging you and the reason why I'm not

1314
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,400
getting responses is because then

1315
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:36,570
there's something wrong with a network

1316
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,190
between me and you so there's a

1317
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,870
possibility that you're alive you're the

1318
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,220
primary you're alive I'm peeing you the

1319
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:42,750
network is dropping that packets but you

1320
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,280
can talk to other clients and you're

1321
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,320
serving requests from other clients you

1322
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:49,140
know and if I if I the master sort of

1323
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,840
designated a new primary for that chunk

1324
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:54,600
now we'd have two primaries processing

1325
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,340
writes but two different copies of the

1326
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,830
data and so now we have totally

1327
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:02,370
diverging copies the data and that's

1328
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:07,560
called that error having two primaries

1329
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,770
or whatever processing requests without

1330
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,570
knowing each other it's called split

1331
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:16,710
brain and I'm writing this on board

1332
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,440
because it's an important idea and it'll

1333
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,160
come up again and it's caused or it's

1334
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,540
usually said to be caused by network

1335
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:33,120
partition that is some network error in

1336
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,260
which the master can't talk to the

1337
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,640
primary but the primary can talk to

1338
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,330
clients sort of partial network failure

1339
01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:41,160
and you know these are some of the these

1340
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,760
are the hardest problems to deal with

1341
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,470
and building these kind of storage

1342
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:49,170
systems okay so that's the problem is we

1343
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,690
want to rule out the possibility of

1344
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:54,280
mistakingly designating two primaries

1345
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,210
for the same chunk the way the

1346
01:03:56,210 --> 01:03:58,610
master achieves that is that when it

1347
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,920
designates a primary it says it gives a

1348
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,320
primary a lease which is basically the

1349
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,590
right to be primary until a certain time

1350
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:08,990
the master knows it remembers and knows

1351
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:12,500
how long the least lasts and the primary

1352
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,960
knows how long is lease lasts if the

1353
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,800
lease expires the primary knows that it

1354
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,570
expires and will simply stop executing

1355
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,150
client requests it'll ignore or reject

1356
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,830
client requests after the lease expired

1357
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,800
and therefore if the master can't talk

1358
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,570
to the primary and the master would like

1359
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:31,220
to designate a new primary the master

1360
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,830
must wait for the lease to expire for

1361
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:35,270
the previous primary so that means

1362
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:37,670
master is going to sit on its hands for

1363
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:40,010
one lease period 60 seconds after that

1364
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,660
it's guaranteed the old primary will

1365
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:44,510
stop operating its primary and now the

1366
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,160
master can see if he doesn't need a new

1367
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,810
primary without producing this terrible

1368
01:04:50,810 --> 01:04:54,460
split brain situation

1369
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:14,119
oh so the question is why is designated

1370
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,920
a new primary bad since the clients

1371
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,079
always ask the master first and so the

1372
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,059
master changes its mind then subsequent

1373
01:05:20,059 --> 01:05:22,819
clients will direct the clients to the

1374
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:26,390
new primary well one reason is that the

1375
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,429
clients cache for efficiency the clients

1376
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:31,279
cache the identity of the primary for at

1377
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:34,009
least for short periods of time even if

1378
01:05:34,009 --> 01:05:37,489
they didn't though the bad sequence is

1379
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:40,640
that I'm the prime the master you ask me

1380
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:43,449
who the primary is I send you a message

1381
01:05:43,449 --> 01:05:46,369
saying the primary is server one right

1382
01:05:46,369 --> 01:05:47,809
and that message is inflate in the

1383
01:05:47,809 --> 01:05:50,630
network and then I'm the master I you

1384
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,160
know I think somebody's failed whatever

1385
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,269
I think that primary is filled I

1386
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:55,219
designated a new primary and I send the

1387
01:05:55,219 --> 01:05:56,209
primary message saying you're the

1388
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:57,619
primary and I start answering other

1389
01:05:57,619 --> 01:06:00,349
clients who ask the primary is saying

1390
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:01,400
that that over there is the primary

1391
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,019
while the message to you is still in

1392
01:06:03,019 --> 01:06:04,880
flight you receive the message saying

1393
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,130
the old primaries the primary you think

1394
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,219
gosh I just got this from the master I'm

1395
01:06:10,219 --> 01:06:11,630
gonna go talk to that primary and

1396
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:13,459
without some much more clever scheme

1397
01:06:13,459 --> 01:06:14,859
there's no way you could realize that

1398
01:06:14,859 --> 01:06:16,849
even though you just got this

1399
01:06:16,849 --> 01:06:19,309
information from the master it's already

1400
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,679
out of date and if that primary serves

1401
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:24,410
your modification requests now we have

1402
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:27,920
to and and respond success to you right

1403
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:35,349
then we have two conflicting replicas

1404
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:38,890
yes

1405
01:06:41,910 --> 01:06:50,710
again you've a new file and no replicas

1406
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,410
okay so if you have a new file no

1407
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,180
replicas or even an existing file and no

1408
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:58,090
replicas the you'll take the path I drew

1409
01:06:58,090 --> 01:07:00,130
on the blackboard the master will

1410
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:02,140
receive a request from a client saying

1411
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,270
oh I'd like to append this file and

1412
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,430
then well I guess the master will first

1413
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,200
see there's no chunks associated with

1414
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,710
that file and it will just make up a new

1415
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:13,570
chunk identifier or perhaps by calling

1416
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:15,730
the random number generator and then

1417
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,920
it'll look in its chunk information

1418
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,080
table and see gosh I don't have any

1419
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,030
information about that chunk and it'll

1420
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,730
make up a new record saying but it must

1421
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:26,410
be special case code where it says well

1422
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:28,720
I don't know any version number this

1423
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:30,850
chunk doesn't exist I'm just gonna make

1424
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:32,740
up a new version number one pick a

1425
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:35,380
random primary and set of secondaries

1426
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:37,900
and tell them look you are responsible

1427
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,660
for this new empty chunk please get to

1428
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:47,020
work the paper says three replicas per

1429
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:50,110
chunk by default so typically a primary

1430
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:52,710
and two backups

1431
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:13,270
okay okay so the maybe the most

1432
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:16,299
important thing here is just to repeat

1433
01:08:16,299 --> 01:08:19,890
the discussion we had a few minutes ago

1434
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:32,140
the intentional construction of GFS we

1435
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,790
had these record appends is that if we

1436
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:41,009
have three we have three replicas you

1437
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:43,779
know maybe a client sends in and a

1438
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:46,719
record appends for record a and all three

1439
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:49,569
replicas or the primary and both of the

1440
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:52,120
secondaries successfully append the data

1441
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,069
the chunks and maybe the first record in

1442
01:08:54,069 --> 01:08:55,689
the trunk might be a in that case and

1443
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:57,930
they all agree because they all did it

1444
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,040
supposing another client comes in says

1445
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,339
look I want append record B but the

1446
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:06,250
message is lost to one of the replicas

1447
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,410
the network whatever supposably the

1448
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:11,589
message by mistake but the other two

1449
01:09:11,589 --> 01:09:13,390
replicas get the message and one of

1450
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:14,380
them's a primary and my other

1451
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:16,000
secondaries they both append the file

1452
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,390
so now what we have is two the replicas

1453
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:21,759
that B and the other one doesn't have

1454
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,410
anything and then may be a third client

1455
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:29,109
wants to append C and maybe the remember

1456
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:30,460
that this is the primary the primary

1457
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:32,738
picks the offset since the primary just

1458
01:09:32,738 --> 01:09:35,109
gonna tell the secondaries look in a

1459
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,620
right record C at this point in the

1460
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:43,450
chunk they all right C here now the

1461
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:45,040
client for be the rule for a client for

1462
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,830
B that for the client that gets us error

1463
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:50,439
back from its request is that it will

1464
01:09:50,439 --> 01:09:53,770
resend the request so now the client

1465
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:56,020
that asked to append record B will ask

1466
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:57,640
again to append record B and this time

1467
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,340
maybe there's no network losses and all

1468
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:05,040
three replicas as a panel record be

1469
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,239
right and they're all lives there I'll

1470
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:09,870
have the most fresh version number and

1471
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:13,150
now if a client reads

1472
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,830
what they see depends on the track which

1473
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:20,020
replicas they look at it's gonna see in

1474
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:22,929
total all three of the records but it'll

1475
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:25,030
see in different orders depending on

1476
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:28,750
which replica reads it'll mean I'll see

1477
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:31,870
a B C and then a repeat of B so if it

1478
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,730
reads this replica it'll see B and then

1479
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:36,969
C if it reads this replica it'll see a

1480
01:10:36,969 --> 01:10:39,340
and then a blank space in the file

1481
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,920
padding and then C and then B so if you

1482
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,199
read here you see C then B if you read

1483
01:10:44,199 --> 01:10:47,320
here you see B and then C so different

1484
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:49,350
readers will see different results and

1485
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:52,330
maybe the worst situation is it some

1486
01:10:52,330 --> 01:10:54,489
client gets an error back from the

1487
01:10:54,489 --> 01:10:58,360
primary because one of the secondaries

1488
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:00,159
failed to do the append and then the

1489
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,260
client dies before we sending the

1490
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,030
request so then you might get a

1491
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:07,030
situation where you have record D

1492
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:11,890
showing up in some of the replicas and

1493
01:11:11,890 --> 01:11:13,750
completely not showing up anywhere in

1494
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,420
the other replicas so you know under

1495
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,659
this scheme we have good properties for

1496
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:23,620
for appends that the primary sent back a

1497
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,800
successful answer for and sort of not so

1498
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,469
great properties for appends where the

1499
01:11:29,469 --> 01:11:32,949
primary sent back of failure and the

1500
01:11:32,949 --> 01:11:35,530
records the replicas just absolutely be

1501
01:11:35,530 --> 01:11:37,540
different all different sets of replicas

1502
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:40,440
yes

1503
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,660
my reading in the paper is that the

1504
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:49,090
client starts at the very beginning of

1505
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:51,310
the process and asked the master again

1506
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:54,190
what's the last chunk in this file you

1507
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:55,240
know because it might be might have

1508
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,710
changed if other people are pending in

1509
01:11:56,710 --> 01:12:02,820
the file yes

1510
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,290
so I can't you know I can't read the

1511
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:22,720
designers mind so the observation is the

1512
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,760
system could have been designed to keep

1513
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,640
the replicas in precise sync it's

1514
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:30,820
absolutely true and you will do it in

1515
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:33,100
labs 2 & 3 so you guys are going to

1516
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,930
design a system that does replication

1517
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,880
that actually keeps the replicas in sync

1518
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,490
and you'll learn you know there's some

1519
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:41,020
various techniques various things you

1520
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,180
have to do in order to do that and one

1521
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:46,150
of them is that there just has to be

1522
01:12:46,150 --> 01:12:47,740
this rule if you want the replicas to

1523
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:50,410
stay in sync it has to be this rule that

1524
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:53,320
you can't have these partial operations

1525
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,490
that are applied to only some and not

1526
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:56,410
others and that means that there has to

1527
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:58,630
be some mechanism to like where the

1528
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,130
system even if the client dies where the

1529
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:01,900
system says we don't wait a minute there

1530
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,060
was this operation I haven't finished it

1531
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:07,390
yet so you build systems in which the

1532
01:13:07,390 --> 01:13:11,820
primary actually make sure the backups

1533
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,360
get every message

1534
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,390
if the first right B failed you think

1535
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:37,739
the C should go with the B

1536
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:40,450
well it doesn't you may think it should

1537
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,130
but the way the system actually operates

1538
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:46,690
is that the primary will add C to the

1539
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:57,730
end of the chunk and the after B yeah I

1540
01:13:57,730 --> 01:13:59,890
mean one reason for this is that at the

1541
01:13:59,890 --> 01:14:01,480
time the right for C comes in the

1542
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,010
primary may not actually know what the

1543
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:05,710
fate of B was because we met multiple

1544
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,510
clients submitting appends concurrently

1545
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:10,600
and you know for high performance you

1546
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,890
want the primary to start the append for

1547
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,860
B first and then as soon as I can got

1548
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:20,170
the next stop set tell everybody did you

1549
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,750
see so that all this stuff happens in

1550
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,270
parallel you know by slowing it down you

1551
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:31,750
could you know the primary could sort of

1552
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,760
decide that B it totally failed and then

1553
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,560
send another round of messages saying

1554
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:39,970
please undo the write of B and there'll

1555
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:43,360
be more complex and slower I'm you know

1556
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,880
again the the justification for this is

1557
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,730
that the design is pretty simple it you

1558
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,820
know it reveals some odd things to

1559
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:58,060
applications and the hope was that

1560
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,680
applications could be relatively easily

1561
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,750
written to tolerate records being in

1562
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,960
different orders or who knows what or if

1563
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,800
they couldn't that applications could

1564
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,080
either make their own arrangements for

1565
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,300
picking an order themselves and writing

1566
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,860
you know sequence numbers in the files

1567
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,739
or something or you could just have a if

1568
01:15:17,739 --> 01:15:20,140
application really was very sensitive to

1569
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,910
order you could just not have concurrent

1570
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:24,220
depends from different clients to the

1571
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:27,520
same file right you could just you know

1572
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,410
close files where order is very

1573
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:31,390
important like say it's a movie file you

1574
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,750
know you don't want to scramble

1575
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:35,840
bytes in a movie file you just write the

1576
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,550
Moot file you write the movie to the

1577
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:40,100
file by one client in sequential order

1578
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:45,040
and not with concurrent record appends

1579
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:56,680
okay all right

1580
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:04,400
the somebody asked basically what would

1581
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,770
it take to turn this design into one

1582
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:08,120
which actually provided strong

1583
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,960
consistency consistency closer to our

1584
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:13,790
sort of single server model where

1585
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:18,680
there's no surprises I don't actually

1586
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,180
know because you know that requires an

1587
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,340
entire new complex design it's not clear

1588
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:24,560
how to mutate GFS to be that design but

1589
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,330
I can list for you lists for you some

1590
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:27,440
things that you would want to think

1591
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,350
about if you wanted to upgrade GFS to a

1592
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:34,460
assistance did have strong consistency

1593
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:37,370
one is that you probably need the

1594
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:40,940
primary to detect duplicate requests so

1595
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:43,460
that when this second becomes in the

1596
01:16:43,460 --> 01:16:44,960
primary is aware that oh actually you

1597
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,030
know we already saw that request earlier

1598
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:50,570
and did it or didn't do it and to try to

1599
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:52,160
make sure that B doesn't show up twice

1600
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:54,140
in the file so one is you're gonna need

1601
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:59,570
duplicate detection another issues you

1602
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,660
probably if a secondary is acting a

1603
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,000
secondary you really need to design the

1604
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,920
system so that if the primary tells a

1605
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,180
secondary to do something

1606
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:10,010
the secondary actually does it and

1607
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,560
doesn't just return error right for a

1608
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,260
strictly consistent system having the

1609
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:16,880
secondaries be able to just sort of blow

1610
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,210
off primary requests with really no

1611
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:24,170
compensation is not okay so I think the

1612
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:25,730
secondaries have to accept requests and

1613
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,460
execute them or if a secondary has some

1614
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,050
sort of permanent damage like it's disk

1615
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,180
got unplugged by mistake this you need

1616
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,160
to have a mechanism to like take the

1617
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,200
secondary out of the system so the

1618
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:39,140
primary can proceed with the remaining

1619
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,750
secondaries but GFS kind of doesn't

1620
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:44,950
either at least not right away

1621
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,350
and so that also means that when the

1622
01:17:49,350 --> 01:17:50,910
primary asks secondary's to append

1623
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:52,800
something the secondaries have to be

1624
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,810
careful not to expose that data to

1625
01:17:54,810 --> 01:17:57,600
readers until the primary is sure that

1626
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,250
all the secondaries really will be able

1627
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:02,610
to execute the append so you might need

1628
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:05,400
sort of multiple phases in the writes of

1629
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,900
first phase in which the primary asks

1630
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,030
the secondaries look you know I really

1631
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:11,310
like you to do this operation can you do

1632
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,560
it but don't don't actually do it yet

1633
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,810
and if all the secondaries answer with a

1634
01:18:15,810 --> 01:18:17,670
promise to be able to do the operation

1635
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:20,550
only then the primary says alright

1636
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:22,080
everybody go ahead and do that operation

1637
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:24,570
you promised and people you know that's

1638
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,210
the way a lot of real world systems

1639
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:28,950
strong consistent systems work and that

1640
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:32,540
trick it's called two-phase commit

1641
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:34,590
another issue is that if the primary

1642
01:18:34,590 --> 01:18:38,370
crashes there will have been some last

1643
01:18:38,370 --> 01:18:40,410
set of operations that the primary had

1644
01:18:40,410 --> 01:18:44,340
launched started to the secondaries but

1645
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:46,890
the primary crashed before it was sure

1646
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,900
whether those all the secondaries got

1647
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,660
there copied the operation or not so if

1648
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,510
the primary crashes you know a new

1649
01:18:54,510 --> 01:18:56,040
primary one of the secondaries is going

1650
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,780
to take over as primary but at that

1651
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:01,200
point the second the new primary and the

1652
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:03,240
remaining secondaries may differ in the

1653
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,580
last few operations because maybe some

1654
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,200
of them didn't get the message before

1655
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,030
the primary crashed and so the new

1656
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:11,490
primer has to start by explicitly

1657
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:15,300
resynchronizing with the secondaries to

1658
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,010
make sure that the sort of the tail of

1659
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:20,750
their operation histories are the same

1660
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:24,060
finally to deal with this problem of oh

1661
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,530
you know there may be times when the

1662
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:28,500
secondaries differ or the client may

1663
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,200
have a slightly stale indication from

1664
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,000
the master of which secondary to talk to

1665
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,940
the system either needs to send all

1666
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,010
client reads through the primary because

1667
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:41,490
only the primary is likely to know which

1668
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:43,860
operations have really happened or we

1669
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:45,570
need a lease system for the secondaries

1670
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:47,400
just like we have for the primary so

1671
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,700
that it's well understood that when

1672
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:55,030
secondary can or can't legally respond

1673
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,650
a client and so these are the things I'm

1674
01:19:56,650 --> 01:19:58,570
aware of that would have to be fixed in

1675
01:19:58,570 --> 01:20:00,550
this system tor added complexity and

1676
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:02,230
chitchat to make it have strong

1677
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,050
consistency and you're actually the way

1678
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:08,020
I got that list was by thinking about

1679
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:09,940
the labs you're gonna end up doing all

1680
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:12,099
the things I just talked about as part

1681
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:13,989
of labs two and three to build a

1682
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:18,940
strictly consistent system okay so let

1683
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:21,099
me spend one minute on there's actually

1684
01:20:21,099 --> 01:20:23,079
I have a link in the notes to a sort of

1685
01:20:23,079 --> 01:20:25,840
retrospective interview about how well

1686
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,389
GFS played out over the first five or

1687
01:20:28,389 --> 01:20:32,770
ten years of his life at Google so the

1688
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:36,219
high-level summary is that the most is

1689
01:20:36,219 --> 01:20:37,690
that was tremendously successful and

1690
01:20:37,690 --> 01:20:40,570
many many Google applications used it in

1691
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:43,000
a number of Google infrastructure was

1692
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,250
built as a late like big file for

1693
01:20:45,250 --> 01:20:47,409
example BigTable I mean was built as a

1694
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,190
layer on top of GFS and MapReduce also

1695
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:54,550
so widely used within Google may be the

1696
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:57,460
most serious limitation is that there

1697
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,289
was a single master and the master had

1698
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:01,510
to have a table entry for every file in

1699
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:04,510
every chunk and that mean does the GFS

1700
01:21:04,510 --> 01:21:06,820
use grew and they're about more and more

1701
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:08,650
files the master just ran out of memory

1702
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:11,980
ran out of RAM to store the files and

1703
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,690
you know you can put more RAM on but

1704
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:15,010
there's limits to how much RAM a single

1705
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:18,309
machine can have and so that was the

1706
01:21:18,309 --> 01:21:19,599
most of the most immediate problem

1707
01:21:19,599 --> 01:21:24,159
people ran into in addition the load on

1708
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,869
a single master from thousands of

1709
01:21:25,869 --> 01:21:28,030
clients started to be too much in the

1710
01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:29,650
master kernel they see if you can only

1711
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:30,940
process however many hundreds of

1712
01:21:30,940 --> 01:21:33,070
requests per second especially the right

1713
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:35,739
things to disk and pretty soon there got

1714
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:39,880
to be too many clients another problem

1715
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,409
with a some applications found it hard

1716
01:21:41,409 --> 01:21:44,260
to deal with this kind of sort of odd

1717
01:21:44,260 --> 01:21:47,500
semantics and a final problem is that

1718
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:49,599
the master that was not an automatic

1719
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:52,059
story for master failover

1720
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:54,400
in the original in the GFS paper as we

1721
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,440
read it like required human intervention

1722
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,170
to deal with a master that had sort of

1723
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:00,460
permanently crashed and needs to be

1724
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:03,579
replaced and that could take tens of

1725
01:22:03,579 --> 01:22:05,980
minutes or more I was just too long for

1726
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:09,360
failure recovery for some applications

1727
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:13,630
okay excellent I'll see you on Thursday

1728
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:15,970
and we'll hear more about all these

1729
01:22:15,970 --> 00:00:00,000
themes over the semester
